The views of police and the public also differ sharply on whether the country has made the changes needed to give blacks equal rights with whites. A lopsided majority of officers (80%) say the country has made the necessary changes. But the public is more divided: 48% say the needed changes have been made while 50% believe that more changes are needed to assure equal rights for black Americans.
Underlying the police views on this question is a substantial difference between black and white police officers â€“ a difference that is, in fact, larger than the gap between the public and police. About nine-in-ten white officers (92%) but only 29% of black officers say the needed changes have already been made (though black officers are about twice as likely as blacks overall to hold this view).
