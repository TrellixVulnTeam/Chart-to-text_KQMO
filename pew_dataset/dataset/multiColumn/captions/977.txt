About two-thirds of Americans (66%) feel worn out by the amount of news there is, while far fewer (32%) say they like the amount of news they are getting, according to a Pew Research Center survey of more than 12,000 U.S. adults conducted in October and November of last year – the first survey in the Center’s nearly yearlong Election News Pathways project. This feeling of news fatigue hasn’t escaped journalists either, some of whom have voiced their exhaustion with the news cycle and the seemingly endless stream of information.
In addition to differences by party and level of news engagement, one demographic divide stands out: race and ethnicity. Roughly three-quarters of white Americans (72%) feel news fatigue, 17 percentage points higher than both black (55%) and Hispanic Americans (55%) – and again similar to the divide measured in 2018. Women are also slightly more likely than men to feel worn out by the amount of news there is (69% vs. 63%). But this sense of exhaustion with the news is about on par across age groups and levels of education.
