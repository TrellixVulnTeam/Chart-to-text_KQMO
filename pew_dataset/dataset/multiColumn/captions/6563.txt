Americans followed news about the economy more closely than another other story, with 20% citing this as their top story of the week; 35% say they followed news about the condition of the economy very closely. This is virtually unchanged from recent weeks, but lower than interest from earlier this spring. The economy received more news coverage than any other topic of the week, 13%, according to PEJ. (NOTE: PEJ’s analysis includes coverage of the debt limit debate with news about the economy; total coverage for the two categories was 19%).
News about the 2012 elections—including Mitt Romney’s announcement that he would seek the Republican nomination—drew 12% of news coverage, about as much as the economy. About one-in-five (21%) followed news about the 2012 candidates very closely, while 11% say they followed it most closely.
Roughly one-in-five also say they followed news about the current situation and events in Afghanistan (20% very closely) and news about anti-government protests and violence in some Middle Eastern countries (18%). However, far more cited news about Afghanistan as their top story than said that about Middle East unrest (12% vs. 4%). Coverage of unrest in the Middle East accounted for 9% of coverage, while news about Afghanistan made up 3% of the newshole.
