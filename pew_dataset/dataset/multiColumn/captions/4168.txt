Venezuelans on the political left are consistently more supportive of government policies, more positive on Maduro and less concerned about major problems affecting the country compared with people on the political right. The left-leaning are also more keen to follow former President Hugo Chávez’s policies and want Maduro (who was vice president under Chávez) to do the same. And people on the political left are more positive about the direction of the country. Still, fewer than half on the left say the country is on the right path.
Meanwhile, Chávez’s legacy continues to loom. When asked whether their country should follow Chávez’s policies, 43% of the public says yes, while just about half (52%) say that Venezuela should not follow his policies.
