There are big ideological divides among Republican voters. Among the issues that divide possible Republican primary voters is government funding of Planned Parenthood, an issue that caused a bitter fight over a government funding bill among House Republicans. About seven-in-ten conservative Republicans (69%) say they are more likely to support a candidate who wants to cut off federal support, compared with 28% of moderate and liberal party members. Other big divides between conservatives and moderates-liberals include whether to raise taxes on the wealthy, how much to compromise with Democrats, and whether to deport all unauthorized immigrants. (In our sample, 69% were conservatives and 31% were moderates and liberals, reflecting relative shares of the party.)
