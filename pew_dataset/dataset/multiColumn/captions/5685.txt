Today, six out of every ten American adults use social networking sites, which are bringing new tone and texture to dating. Among social networking site users with recent dating experience (whom we define as those who are single and looking or who have been in a relationship for 10 years or less), 30% have used social media to find out more information about someone they were interested in dating. Another 12% have friended or followed someone on a social networking site because one of their friends suggested they could be a good romantic match.
These social media users who are looking for love are particularly likely to be young. Some 41% of users with recent dating experience between the ages of 18 and 29 have used sites like Twitter or Facebook to get more information on a potential date. An additional 18% have friended or followed someone from a friendâ€™s recommendation.
