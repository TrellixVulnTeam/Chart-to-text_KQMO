Cataloniaâ€™s recent secession attempts come at a difficult time for Spain. Across the country, people distrust the national government and feel dissatisfied with the way democracy is working in their nation. And Catalans are even more negative on these issues than those living in other regions of Spain, according to a new analysis of data from a Pew Research Center survey conducted in March and April.
An overwhelming majority of the Spanish public (81%) does not trust the national government to do the right thing for their country. In Catalonia, this figure reaches 91%, including 53% who say they do not trust Madrid at all. In other regions of Spain, 79% lack trust in their government and only about four-in-ten express absolutely no trust.
Spanish people are also unhappy about their democracy. Overall, 74% say they are dissatisfied with the way democracy is working in their nation. Among Catalans, this figure is 81%, with 41% saying they are not at all satisfied. While 73% of people living in other regions of Spain are dissatisfied with democracy, only 28% feel this way strongly.
