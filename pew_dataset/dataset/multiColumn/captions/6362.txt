While the presidential campaign topped the public’s news interest and media coverage, Americans also continued to closely track news about the nation’s economy.
Nearly two-in-ten (17%) say they followed news about the condition of the economy most closely. Economic news made up 7% of coverage. Just under four-in-ten (37%) say they followed news about the economy very closely, a level of interest that has shifted only slightly since the start of the year.
One-in-ten (10%) say their top story was the controversy over Rush Limbaugh’s crude comments about a woman who advocates requiring health care coverage for contraceptives, even for workers at certain religiously affiliated institutions. Twice as many women than men say this was their top story (14% vs. 7%), though men and women are about equally likely to say they followed this news very closely. Overall, 20% followed this story very closely.
Two other foreign stories attracted modest interest. Fewer than two-in-ten (17%) say they followed news about the political violence in Syria very closely; 6% say this was their top story. News about the ongoing violence in Syria made up 4% of coverage.
