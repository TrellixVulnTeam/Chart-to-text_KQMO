Public interest in news about the campaign is lower than it was in October 2008. Currently 48% say they are following news about the election very closely. That is the highest percentage this year, though not significantly different from the previous two weeks, (45% in Oct. 12-14 and Oct. 4-7).
At a comparable point in mid-October 2008 (Oct. 17-20), 61% said they were following campaign very closely â€“ the highest percentage of the campaign. Interest fell to 44% the following week, before rebounding to 57% the weekend before the election.
