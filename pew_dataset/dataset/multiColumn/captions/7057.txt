Americans continue to be very interested in news about health care reform and the economy, and far less interested in overseas news. About four-in-ten followed the economy (41%) and health care reform (39%) very closely. By contrast, just 19% tracked news about the situation in Iraq very closely. Far fewer followed President Obama’s trip to Mexico or Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s trip to Africa (9% each), and just 7% followed news about mudslides and flooding in Taiwan caused by a typhoon.
