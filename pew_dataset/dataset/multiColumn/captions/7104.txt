Over the past four years, the demographic makeup of online classified users changed very little. The percentages of demographic groups using online classifieds grew at a rate that mirrors the growth of the total online population using these sites: the percentage of all internet users to utilize classified sites grew 27 percentage points from 2005 to 2009, while most other demographic groupsâ€™ growth ranged from 25 to 29 percentage points.
The exception to this pattern involves different generational use of classified sites. Online 18-29 year olds saw a 30 percentage-point increase in their use of online classified ads, and 30-49 year old internet users marked a 32 point increase in online classifieds use. On the other hand, internet users ages 50-64 saw a 21 point increase, and online seniors (age 65+) saw the smallest increase overall: 13 percentage points.
