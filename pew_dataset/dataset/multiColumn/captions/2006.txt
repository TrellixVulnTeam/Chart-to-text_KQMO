There is a general lack of confidence in Chinese President Xi Jinping. A median of 34% across the countries surveyed voice confidence in Xi, while 56% lack confidence in him. This puts him slightly ahead of Russian President Vladimir Putin (30%) and U.S. President Donald Trump (27%) in international confidence ratings, but behind German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron. Xiâ€™s strongest backers are in the Philippines (58%), Kenya, Nigeria and Tunisia (all 53%), and Russia (50%). Confidence in Xi is particularly low in Europe. Just 9% of Poles and 11% of Greeks trust him. Confidence in Xi in the three sub-Saharan African nations surveyed is higher than in any European country polled. Half of Americans lack confidence in the Chinese leader.
