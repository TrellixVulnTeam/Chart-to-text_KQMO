Younger adults are far more likely than their elders to often get news on a mobile device. About seven-in-ten (72%) adults ages 18 to 29 often get news this way, compared with 38% among those ages 65 and older. Conversely, those 65 and older are more likely to often get news on a desktop or laptop computer than those ages 18 to 29 (34% vs. 23%).
Race and partisanship also play a role in mobile news use. For example, about six-in-ten Hispanic adults (63%) often get news through a mobile device, compared with 54% of whites. The opposite is true when it comes to getting news on desktop or laptop computers (23% among Hispanic adults vs. 31% of whites). Black adults fall between Hispanic and white adults on this question.
Meanwhile, roughly six-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (62%) often get news on a mobile device, compared with 53% of Republicans and Republican leaners. When it comes to desktop news use, there are no major differences between Democrats and Republicans.
Those with more formal education and higher incomes are more likely to get news on both mobile and desktop or laptop computers. U.S. adults with a college degree, for instance, are more likely to often get news on mobile than those with a high school education or less (65% vs. 49%).
