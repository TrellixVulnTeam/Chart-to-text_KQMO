Large majorities of Americans say all eight of the issues included on the survey are at least a somewhat serious problem for the U.S. And seven of these issues are considered a serious problem by roughly eight-in-ten or more of those polled.
All three economic issues are rated as very serious problems by roughly half or more of the American public. Two-in-three say the large amount of U.S. debt held by China ($1.27 trillion) is a very serious problem, and six-in-ten hold this view about the loss of jobs to China. Concerns about job losses are especially common among older Americans, women, people with less education, those with lower incomes and Republicans. About half (52%) consider the trade deficit (which totaled $31.6 billion in July) a very serious problem.
