Attention to the presidential election at this point in the cycle is also at a historic high in Pew Research Center surveys dating back more than three decades. Today, 63% of all U.S. adults say they have been following news about candidates for the 2020 presidential election very or fairly closely. This is 9 points higher than in August of 2015, and 10 or more points higher than similar points for all elections dating back to when this question was first asked in 1987.
In the past, attention to presidential candidates was generally higher in election years when both political parties held primary contests. For example, early interest in news about candidates was higher in 2015 and 2007 than it was in 2011 â€“ when only one party held primaries for the presidential nomination.
