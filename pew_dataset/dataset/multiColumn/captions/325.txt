The Supreme Court was viewed favorably by a 70% majority of Americans in the August survey. The public’s views of the court have been positive in recent years – recovering from a low point in 2015 that followed controversial rulings on the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage.
Since August 2019, the share of Republicans with a favorable impression of the court has declined 10 percentage points (from 85% to 75%), while Democrats’ views have become more positive, increasing from 57% to 67%.
In views of the Supreme Court among the public overall, majorities continued to hold more favorable than unfavorable views. When asked in an online survey using the Center’s American Trends Panel, 70% of Americans expressed a favorable opinion of the Supreme Court, while 29% had an unfavorable view. In a contemporaneous phone survey, 62% had a favorable opinion of the court, while 32% viewed it unfavorably. The share offering no opinion was higher on the phone survey (6%) than on the online survey (2%). In both survey modes, Republicans were more likely than Democrats to express favorable opinions of the court.
