Most of the world has greater confidence in Obama than in Putin to do the right thing in world affairs by better than two-to-one (a median of 56% to 23%), according to a 44 nation poll by the Pew Research Center, conducted this year after the winter Olympics in Russia but before the recent conflict over responsibility for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which the U.S. has blamed on pro-Russian separatists supplied with weapons by the Russian military. An earlier 21 country survey in 2012 found a similar two-to-one margin of favorability for the U.S. president.
Putin has never been as well-known as Obama, nor generally as well liked. Majorities or pluralities in only six of the 44 countries surveyed say they have confidence in Putin to do the right thing in world affairs. Just 16% of Americans say they have a great deal or some confidence in the Russian leader. And the median confidence level in seven European Union nations is 18%. Only 20% of Japanese see his conduct of foreign policy favorably.
