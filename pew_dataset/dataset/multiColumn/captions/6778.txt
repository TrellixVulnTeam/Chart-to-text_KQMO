Americans paid close attention last week to three story lines with links to the events of Sept. 11, 2001. In addition to interest in the possible Koran burning (33% very closely), the public also very closely tracked news about developments in Afghanistan (30%) and Sept. 11 anniversary commemorations (33%).
Nearly as many (9%) say they followed news about the ninth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks most closely. News about commemorations made up 2% of coverage. More than two-in-ten (22%) say they followed news about this yearâ€™s congressional elections very closely. This was the most closely followed news for 8% and accounted for 12% of coverage.
Some 16% say they followed the debate in Washington over competing Democratic and Republican tax plans very closely; 3% say this was the news they followed most closely. News about the tax plans made up 4% of coverage. In its overall analysis, PEJ included news about the tax debate with news about the economic crisis in general, a topic that accounted for 17% of coverage last week.
