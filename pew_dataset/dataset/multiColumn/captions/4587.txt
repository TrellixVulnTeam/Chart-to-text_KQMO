In the wake of Europe’s recession and currency crisis, support for the European Union and the belief that European economic integration was good for one’s country had declined precipitously across Europe, reaching a low point in 2013.
But this year, European public opinion is looking more upbeat. Favorable views of the EU and faith in a single, shared market are generally rebounding in the major EU member states, according to a new six-nation survey by the Pew Research Center.
In Europe, the economic mood is brightening somewhat. This year, a median of 28% in the six nations we surveyed – France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom – believe that economic conditions in their country are good. While that’s hardly an endorsement of the economy, it reflects an increase of 16 percentage points from two years ago.
