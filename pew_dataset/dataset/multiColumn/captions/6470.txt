While the media divided its attention between news about the 2012 candidates for president and news about the economy, the public continued to focus most closely on news about the struggling economy.
A quarter of the public (25%) says that news about the condition of the economy was their top story of the week, while 17% say they followed news about the presidential campaign most closely.
Interest in news about the economy has changed little in recent weeks. Nearly half (46%) say they followed news about the economy very closely last week, about the same as one week earlier. News about the economy accounted for 14% of coverage, according to PEJ.
