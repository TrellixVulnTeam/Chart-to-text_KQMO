In a Pew Research Center survey conducted in March, 63% of people said they had a favorable opinion of their local government, a level thatâ€™s stayed fairly constant over several years; 57% expressed favorable views of their state government, a five-point uptick from last year. But just 28% rated the federal government favorably, versus 65% unfavorably; the favorability rating was five points lower than a year earlier and the lowest ever in a Pew Research Center survey.
