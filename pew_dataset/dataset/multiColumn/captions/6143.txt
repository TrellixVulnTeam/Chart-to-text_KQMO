Many Asian countries – including China, Korea, Japan and Vietnam – use a lunar calendar in addition to the solar calendar commonly used in the United States. People in those countries – as well as here in the United States – will start celebrating the Lunar New Year this weekend.
Overall, about two-thirds of Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Vietnamese Americans (68%) celebrate the Lunar New Year, or what is often referred to as the Chinese New Year. Commemoration of the Lunar New Year is highest among Vietnamese Americans (93%) and Chinese Americans (82%) – who are about as likely to celebrate the Lunar New Year as to celebrate Thanksgiving. Fewer Korean Americans (45%) and Japanese Americans (30%) say they celebrate the Lunar New Year.
