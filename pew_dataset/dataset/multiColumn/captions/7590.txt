While overall approval of President Bush’s job performance has tumbled over the past year, he may still prove to be effective on the campaign stump for Republican candidates in certain parts of the country. In Pew Research Center surveys conducted over the past year, an average of 37% of Americans register approval of the job George W. Bush is doing as president, while 55% disapprove. But the president has significant pockets of support in certain areas, particularly in the South and Mountain West. Voters in Utah, in particular, remain strongly behind the president – over the past year, 63% approve of his job performance. Similarly, in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Alabama and Kansas more voters surveyed in the past year approve rather than disapprove.
Not surprisingly, the president’s job ratings are weak in many Democratic- leaning states. Just 24% of Maryland voters interviewed over the past year give Bush favorable marks, while 67% disapprove of his job performance, and the balance of opinion is nearly as bad in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Similarly, more voters in Oregon, Illinois, California and New York disapprove of the president than approve by margins of roughly two-to-one.
