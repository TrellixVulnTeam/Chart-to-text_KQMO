Among young Latinos who rely on television for news, Spanish is on the decline. A new analysis of a 2012 Pew Research Center survey of Latino adults finds that fully 90% of Latinos ages 18 to 29 who get their news from television do so in English. When it comes to other forms of entertainment, such as television and music, use of English is higher among younger Latinos.
