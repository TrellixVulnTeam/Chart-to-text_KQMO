Today, the Pew Research Center released a new report examining the local news environment in three U.S. metropolitan areas of different population size and demographic makeup: Denver, Macon, Ga., and Sioux City, Iowa. Here are five key takeaways based on the report, which incorporates data from surveys, analysis of media content, an audit of local news providers and social media analysis.
Local news matters to local residents. About nine-in-ten residents in each city said they followed news about their local area at least somewhat closely, while about eight-in-ten said the same about neighborhood news. This is true in Denver, where researchers found 143 sources of news and information, but it’s also true in Macon, with 24 sources, and Sioux City, with 31 sources.
Digital technology has impacted news habits in all three cities, but at different levels. More than half of residents in Sioux City and two-thirds in Macon and Denver access at least one news provider digitally, and roughly a quarter say they get at least some local news from social networking sites. But within those numbers, residents of Denver are most likely to say the internet is very important to keeping up with local news (45%, compared with 38% in Macon and 33% in Sioux City), and news providers there make greater use of digital capabilities such as embedded links in news stories (31% of news stories in Denver contained these, versus fewer than 5% in Macon or Sioux City). Of these cities, it is Macon – the least prosperous but the one with the highest level of interest in local news – where residents are most likely to access a specific news provider on a social networking site.
