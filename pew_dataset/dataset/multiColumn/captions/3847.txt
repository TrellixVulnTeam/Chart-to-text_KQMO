In addition to holding the EU in low regard, Greeks are the most critical of EU policy on a range of issues. More than nine-in-ten Greeks disapprove of the EU’s handling of the refugee crisis and European economic issues. A median of more than seven-in-ten Europeans disapprove of the EU’s handling of refugees and a majority disapprove of its handling of economic issues, a far cry from the near universal disapproval in Greece.
