Debt-to-income ratios have increased for young student debtors, even as they have declined for other young households since 2008. The typical young, college-educated student debtor household has debts equivalent to two years of income. Young, college-educated households with no student debt and less-educated households with student debt carry half this debt load, or the equivalent of one year of income.
Young households that borrowed for college are less satisfied with their personal financial situation than those who didnâ€™t and are less likely to say their education has paid off.
