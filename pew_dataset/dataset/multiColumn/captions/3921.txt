Currently, 78% of Democrats approve and just 19% disapprove of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), little changed in recent years.
Among Republicans, just 9% approve and 89% disapprove of the law. The share of Republicans who approve of the law rose from 11% in February 2015 to 18% last July, before falling back to 9% in the new survey.
Independentsâ€™ support for the law also has declined since July, from 45% to 39%. That change has come entirely among independents who lean toward the Democratic Party. Currently, 59% of Democratic-leaning independents approve of the health care law, compared with 71% last summer. Only about one-in-five Republican-leaning independents (18%) approve of the law, little changed since July (17%).
