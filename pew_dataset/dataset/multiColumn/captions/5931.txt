The overall U.S. birth rate declined to a record low in 2011, but newly-released government data showed remarkably different trends for young and older women. Birth rates continued to decline to an all-time low among women in their teens and early 20s, while rising to the highest level in four decades among women in their early 40s.
The final data for 2011 from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) confirm the record-low birth rate (63.2 births per 1,000 women ages 15-44) shown in preliminary data released last fall, and offer the first details about trends for different demographic groups.
During the period from 2010 to 2011, birth rates among teens ages 15-19 dropped 8%, and among women ages 20-24 declined 5%â€”in both cases reaching historic lows in 2011. At the other end of the age spectrum, the birth rate for women ages 40-44 rose 1%, to 10.3 births per 1,000 women in that age group. The last time the rate came that close was in 1967, when it was 10.6.
