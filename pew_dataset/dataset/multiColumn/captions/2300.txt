Young adults continue to be more likely than older people to express a favorable opinion of labor unions. A 68% majority of those ages 18 to 29 hold a positive view of unions, compared with only about half (51%) of those 50 and older.
Adults younger than 30 also are somewhat less likely to view businesses favorably: Fewer than half (46%) hold a favorable opinion of business corporations, while 47% hold an unfavorable view. By contrast, older Americans are more likely to be positive than negative in their views. Adults under 30 are the only age group in which a larger share has a favorable view of labor unions than of business corporations.
