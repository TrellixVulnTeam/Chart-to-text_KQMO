The decade-long decline in U.S. newsroom employment hit midcareer workers the hardest. The number of full-time midcareer newsroom employees – defined as those ages 35 to 54 – dropped by 42% between 2008 and 2018, from about 52,900 to 30,800 workers, according to Census Bureau data. The number of newsroom workers ages 55 and older increased by 31% during this period, from about 16,400 to 21,400 – but not enough to offset the losses in the midcareer age group. The number of younger newsroom employees (ages 18 to 34) remained relatively stable, with no significant change occurring over the decade.
