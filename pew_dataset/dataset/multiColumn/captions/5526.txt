Hate crimes in which race and sexual orientation were cited showed a decline between 2004 and 2012, from 58% to 46%, while hate crimes motivated by a personâ€™s disability remained about the same (11%). The BJS noted that in many cases, victims reported more than one bias motivation for the same crime.
