Women are more likely to have no schooling than men. Nearly a quarter (23%) of women are uneducated, compared with 14% of the worldâ€™s men. In the least educated parts of the world (Middle East-North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa) roughly half of adult women have not been to school for even a year.
In addition, older adults are more likely to have no education than younger ones. About a quarter of those who in 2010 were between the ages of 55 and 75 have no schooling. By contrast, among those who in 2010 were between the ages of 25 and 34, the share without education is 15%, a sign that more people are now going to school than four or five decades ago.
Among the young, there also is less of a gender gap. Among men and women between the ages of 55 and 75, 19% and 34% have no education, a 15% difference. But among those between the ages of 25 and 34, the gap between men with no schooling (12%) and women (19%) is only 7%.
