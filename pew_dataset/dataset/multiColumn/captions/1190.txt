The biggest difference between populists and nonpopulists is in the Czech Republic. Around six-in-ten (61%) of those with a favorable view of the Czech Freedom and Direct Democracy party (SPD) have confidence in Putin on world affairs, compared with just 24% of those with an unfavorable view of the party. SPD leaders have been vocal about their opposition to Western sanctions on Russia after the annexation of Crimea and have aligned themselves with the Czech Republicâ€™s pro-Russia president.
