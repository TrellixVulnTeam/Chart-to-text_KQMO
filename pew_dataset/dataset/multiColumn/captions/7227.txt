Four-in-ten Americans listed the campaign as the single news story they were following more closely than any other last week. The national news media, meanwhile, focused heavily on the campaign last week, devoting 52% of its overall coverage to election news, according to Pew’s PEJ.
While the public continued to pay close attention to the economy, the percent following economic news very closely (52%) was down significantly from the previous week (62%). Roughly one-in-three (34%) listed the economy as their most closely followed news story, while more (40%) named the campaign. For the previous five weeks, the economy had been the public’s most closely followed news story.
The national news media devoted 22% of its overall coverage to the economy crisis last week. Coverage of the economy has fallen off significantly in recent weeks. The week of September 29, when Congress was debating the financial bailout package, stories about the economic crisis accounted for 45% of news.
