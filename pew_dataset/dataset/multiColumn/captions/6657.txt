A majority of the public continues to say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy. At the same time, more than three-quarters (77%) say they are hearing mostly bad news about gas prices.
About two-thirds (64%) say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy, down slightly from the 68% that said this in early January. About three-in-ten (29%) report hearing mostly bad news. Just 6% say they are hearing mostly good news about economic conditions.
These numbers have changed only slightly since January, when perceptions of the economic news mix proved much more positive than one month earlier. In January, 24% said economic news was mostly bad, a drop of 15 points from 39% in December.
