A quarter of the public (25%) says they very closely followed the ongoing discussions in Washington last week over how to handle the federal budget deficit and reduce the national debt; just 8% say this was the news they followed most closely. The only week this year when the deficit debate drew substantial public interest was in early April, when a government shutdown loomed. In the April 7-10 News Interest survey, 47% followed news about the threat of a shutdown very closely and 31% followed this story most closely.
Nearly two-in-ten (18%) say they followed news about the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians very closely; 5% say this was the news they followed most closely. News about the conflict – and the response to efforts by President Obama to restart negotiations over creation of a Palestinian state – made up 5% of coverage.
Meanwhile, about one-in-ten (11%) say they followed news about Obama’s trip to Europe last week very closely. Just 3% say this was the news they followed most closely. The president’s trip made up 3% of coverage.
