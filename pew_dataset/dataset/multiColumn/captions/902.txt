Adults who have never been married or who are currently living with a partner are the most likely to say they have ever used an online dating service: 52% and 46%, respectively, say this. By comparison, 35% of Americans who are divorced, separated or widowed say they have ever used a dating site or app, while 16% of married adults say the same, according to a new analysis of a Pew Research Center survey conducted in October 2019.
The share of Americans who have ever used an online dating platform has gone up across marital status groups, but the increase has been most pronounced among those living with a partner. The share of cohabiting Americans who say they had ever used a dating site or app has roughly tripled from 15% in 2015 to 46% today. (Pew Research Center’s 2015 survey about online dating was conducted via telephone, while the 2019 survey was fielded online through the Center’s American Trends Panel. In addition, there were some changes in question wording between these surveys. Please read the methodology section for full details on how the 2019 survey was conducted.)
