In the days before Barack Obama and George W. Bush took the oath of office, majorities also said it was too early to tell how successful their presidencies would be. But in both cases, those that did offer predictions were more likely to say each would be successful than unsuccessful. For example, in 2009 30% said Obama would be successful while just 4% predicted he would be unsuccessful; 65% said it was too early to tell.
