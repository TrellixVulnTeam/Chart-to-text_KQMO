However, open borders is not the same as no borders. Fewer than one-in-five Ukrainians (12%) and Russians (16%) think the two countries should unite as a single state. Those living in Ukraine’s East (26%) and South (19%) are somewhat more enthusiastic about the idea of reuniting Ukraine and Russia, but support falls to the single digits in the country’s Center (5%) and West (1%). Similarly, a 32%-minority of Russian-speakers think the two countries should merge, compared with just 9% among Ukrainian-speakers.
At least in the days leading up to Viktor Yanukovych’s removal from office, events in Ukraine had yet to boost enthusiasm for a single Ukrainian-Russian state. In both countries, support for a unified state has remained relatively flat over the past six years. In 2008, 20% of Ukrainians backed such a move, compared with 12% today. In Russia, attitudes have changed even less: in 2008, 19% backed reunification vs. 16% today.
