Of the seven leaders tested in the survey, Americans have the lowest levels of confidence in Russian President Vladimir Putin, with about one-in-five (21%) saying he will do the right thing in world affairs. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi receive equivalent ratings: About four-in-ten (39%) in the U.S. have confidence in each.
Americans have generally lacked confidence in Putin in surveys conducted over the past 15 years, but their opinions have been especially low since Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. That year, only 16% had confidence in Putin. All interviews were conducted after Putin’s March 2014 statement that Russia would annex Crimea. In each year since then, around one-in-five Americans have reported confidence in Putin.
