A 52% majority of the public thinks a health care reform bill will pass over the next year; 37% say that they do not expect a bill to pass and 11% arenâ€™t sure. Opinion on this question has been largely stable throughout the month of November. And despite the Nov. 21 procedural vote in the Senate, which allowed for debate on a bill to begin, the public did not shift its views on the prospects for reform. Respondents interviewed in the two days immediately following the vote were no more likely than those interviewed prior to the vote to say they expected a health care reform bill to pass.
As has consistently been the case, Democrats are more likely than Republicans and independents to say they think a health care reform bill will pass over the next year. Two-thirds (66%) of Democrats expect a bill to pass compared with 49% of independents and 40% of Republicans.
