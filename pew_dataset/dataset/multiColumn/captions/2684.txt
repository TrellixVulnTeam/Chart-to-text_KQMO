Across these countries, a median of 66% say being a member of the official or favored faith is very or somewhat important to national identity (e.g. “being truly Armenian”). In most countries without an official or preferred religion, substantially smaller shares (median of 43%) say this about the dominant religious group in their country.
In Greece, for instance, where Greek Orthodoxy is the country’s official religion, 76% of adults say being Orthodox is important to being Greek. In Poland, where the Roman Catholic Church is preferred by the government, 64% say being Catholic is important to being truly Polish.
