Most Americans continue to say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the nation’s still-struggling economy. Just more than half say this (53%), a number little changed since early July (54%).
For the first six months of 2010, the public was more likely to say they were hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy, but a spate of developments in early summer – signs the recovery had slowed and continuing high unemployment – led to a shift. More said they were hearing mostly bad news about the economy, while fewer said they were hearing a mix of good and bad news. About four-in-ten (39%) now say they are hearing mostly bad news, consistent with numbers since the early days of summer (42% in July).
With the survey in the field as the federal government released a jobs report that showed the unemployment rate hovering around 9.6%, few (6%) say they are hearing mostly good news about the economy. That’s comparable to most months this year.
