Republicans are divided ideologically over stricter environmental regulations. Among the roughly two-thirds of Republicans and Republican leaners who describe their political views as conservative, 60% say stricter laws cost too many jobs and hurt the economy. Among the partyâ€™s moderates and liberals (who make up about a third of all Republicans and GOP leaners), 60% say stricter environmental laws are worth the cost.
There also are gender, age and educational differences in these attitudes. Women (69%) are more likely than men (58%) to say stricter environmental laws and regulations are worth the cost. And while majorities in every age group say stricter environmental laws are worth it, a larger share of those ages 18 to 29 (72%) say this compared with those who are older than 50 (60%).
