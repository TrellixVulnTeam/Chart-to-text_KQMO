As was the case in September, more Americans (49%) say their bigger concern is that the government’s anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough to adequately protect the country than that the policies have gone too far in restricting the average person’s civil liberties (37%).
This represents a change from July 2013, after Snowden’s NSA leaks, when 47% said they were more concerned about civil liberties than inadequate protection against terrorism (35%). The current state of opinion is closer to views between 2004 and 2010, when the public consistently expressed more concern about adequate anti-terrorism protection than restriction of the average person’s civil liberties.
The shift in opinion since July 2013 has occurred across the board. By nearly two-to-one, Republicans are more concerned about anti-terrorism policies not going far enough to protect the country (57%) than about these policies placing too many restrictions on civil liberties (30%). In July 2013, by 43% to 38%, more Republicans expressed greater concern that anti-terror policies had infringed on civil liberties.
