The public continued to focus most closely on the outcome of the midterm elections last week as news coverage highlighted their impact on the balance of power and the agenda in Washington.
A quarter of the public (25%) says they followed news about the election outcome more closely than any other major news. Nearly as many (20%) say they followed news about the still-struggling economy most closely, according to the latest News Interest Index survey conducted Nov. 11-14 among 1,001 adults.
