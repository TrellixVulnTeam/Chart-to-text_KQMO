About a third (34%) now say they think health care legislation will pass this year, up from 27% one week earlier. Still, that is far below the 57% recorded Jan. 15-18, just before the special election in Massachusetts for what had been Ted Kennedyâ€™s seat in the U.S. Senate. Immediately after Republican Scott Brown won the Jan. 19 vote, the percentage saying they thought a health care bill would pass this year plummeted to about a quarter (27% Jan. 22-25).
Following the White House health care summit that included President Obama and lawmakers from both parties, about a third of Americans (34%) say they think legislation will pass this year, up from 27% in the week before the meeting. Currently, 54% say they think a bill will not pass, while 62% held that view before the summit.
