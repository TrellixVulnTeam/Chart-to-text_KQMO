A month ago, partisan differences in views of economic news reached record levels. Those differences, while still substantial, have narrowed since September as Republican views of economic news have improved both generally, and across most specific sectors.
Currently, about half (49%) of Republicans say economic news is mostly bad, down from 60% a month ago. Just 13% of Democrats say economic news is mostly bad, which is virtually unchanged since September. Independentsâ€™ views also are little changed (36% mostly bad in September, 29% currently).
