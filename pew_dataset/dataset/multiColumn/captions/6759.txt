Barack Obama’s job approval rating, currently at 46% among all registered voters, has fallen substantially since the start of his presidency, across all age groups, Millennials included. In September, 58% of voters younger than 30 approved of Obama’s job performance, down from 71% in February 2009.
Yet younger voters remain far more supportive of Obama than any other age group. On balance, far more Millennials continue to approve (58%) than disapprove (33%) of the job he is doing. By comparison, voters ages 30 to 49 are divided in their assessments of Obama, and a clear majority of those age 50 and older disapprove of the job Obama is doing.
