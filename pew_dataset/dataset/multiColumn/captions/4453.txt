Although minorities (including black, Hispanic, Asian American, Native American and multiracial populations) make up over a third of the U.S. adult population (35%), they make up only 22% of the local television news workforce, according to a study by the Radio Television Digital News Association. The figure is even lower for daily newspapers, where only 13% of newsroom employees are minorities, according to an annual survey of newsroom employment by the American Society of News Editors (ASNE). These figures have changed little over the past two decades.
Traditionally, journalists have begun their careers at smaller organizations rather than large-market newspapers and TV stations. But for both local TV and newspapers, itâ€™s the small outlets that are least likely to have minority employees. Low-circulation newspapers are the least likely to hire minorities for their first full-time professional jobs, and small-market local TV stations are the least likely to promote them into news director positions.
