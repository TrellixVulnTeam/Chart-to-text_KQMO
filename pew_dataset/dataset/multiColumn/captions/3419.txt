Today, 64% say they have a favorable view of Obama, including 34% who say they have a very favorable view. In October last year, only about half (49%) had a favorable view of Obama, including only about two-in-ten (22%) who viewed him very favorably.
Though the presidentâ€™s favorability ratings have improved over the last year, Michelle Obama remains more popular than her husband: Nearly three-quarters of the public (72%) also have a very (46%) or mostly (25%) favorable opinion of the first lady, compared with 22% who view her unfavorably. Views of Michelle Obama have changed only modestly over the course of eight years, though the share who see her favorably is up 11 points from last year.
