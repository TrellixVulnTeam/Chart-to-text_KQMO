In a poll conducted September 5-8, 35% say their opinion of McCain has become more favorable in recent days, while 24% say their opinion of the Republican nominee has become less favorable. This marks the second week in a row where changing opinions of McCain have been more positive than negative. For her part, Palin appears to have helped boost McCain’s image, and her convention speech drew a highly favorable response. However, only a narrow majority (52%) says she is qualified to serve as president, while 39% say she is not qualified.
Obama’s image was largely unchanged last week. While 20% say they have come to have a more favorable opinion of him in recent days, an identical percentage says their opinion is less favorable; most people (59%) say their opinion of Obama has not changed. A week earlier, just after the Democratic convention, 29% said their opinion of Obama had improved recently compared with 19% who said their view of him had become less favorable.
