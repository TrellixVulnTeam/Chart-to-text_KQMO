Public interest in health care reform shows no signs of slackening, with news about the debate continuing to top the public’s news agenda.
Fully 46% name health care as the story they followed more closely than any other last week – double the percentage who named the week’s second most closely followed story (economy, 23%). Moreover, health care is far and away the story people say they have been talking about most with friends: 55% say this, compared with 20% who name the economy.
