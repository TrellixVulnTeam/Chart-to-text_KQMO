Joblessness among blacks and Hispanics continues to be well above that of whites, and remains higher for all racial groups than before the Great Recession. However, unemployment is falling faster among blacks than among whites: The jobless rate among blacks fell nine-tenths of a percentage point last month, as 228,000 more adults found work. Since black unemployment peaked at 16.8% in March 2010, it’s fallen 4.2 percentage points, to 12.6%.
White unemployment peaked much lower than that of blacks — 9.2% in November 2009 — but has fallen by a lesser amount since then: 2.6 percentage points, to 6.6% last month. The number of employed and unemployed whites fell in July, while the number not counted as being the labor force — due to retirement, going back to school, or simply giving up on looking for work — rose for the second month in a row.
