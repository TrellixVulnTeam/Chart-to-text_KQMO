Americansâ€™ views about tech companies have turned far less positive in recent years. Controversies related to digital privacy, made-up news, harassment and other issues may have taken their toll on public attitudes about tech companies. The share of Americans who say these companies are having a positive effect on the way things are going in the country has declined sharply since 2015, according to a July 2019 survey. Four years ago, the majority of U.S. adults (71%) said these companies had a positive impact on the country, compared with 50% today.
