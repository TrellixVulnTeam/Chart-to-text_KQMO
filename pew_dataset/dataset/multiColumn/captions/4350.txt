“Mexican” is the identity term used most often. When asked in a 2013 Pew Research Center survey what term they use to describe themselves most often, a majority of Mexican adults (57%) say they most often use the term “Mexican.” About two-in-ten (21%) say they describe themselves most often as “American.” The same share most often use the pan-ethnic terms of “Hispanic” or “Latino” to describe their identity. By comparison, 54% of all U.S. Hispanics say they prefer their ancestor’s Hispanic origin term to describe their identity, 23% say they describe themselves most often as “American” and two-in-ten use the pan-ethnic terms of “Hispanic” or “Latino” to describe their identity.
Preference for Hispanic or Latino. In regard to the pan-ethnic terms of “Hispanic” or “Latino,” half of Mexican adults have no preference for either term. Among those who have a preference, more prefer the term “Hispanic” (35% of all Mexicans), while 13% prefer the term “Latino.” By comparison, half of all Hispanic adults have no preference for either term, and among those who do have a preference Hispanic is favored over Latino 2-to-1.
Typical American or not. When asked in the 2013 Pew Research survey whether they thought of themselves as a typical American or very different from a typical American, the responses are split. Some 48% of Mexican adults see themselves as a “typical American,” while 46% think of themselves as “very different from a typical American.” Hispanic adults overall share similar views as Mexicans, and on balance Hispanic adults are more likely to see themselves as a typical American (49%) than very different from a typical American (44%).
