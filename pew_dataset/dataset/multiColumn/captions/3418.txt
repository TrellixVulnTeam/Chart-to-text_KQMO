Throughout Obama’s two terms, an overwhelming majority of blacks have expressed approval of his job performance: Today, 90% say they approve, while just 6% say they disapprove.
Obama’s approval ratings among Hispanics have shifted over his eight-year term. With just a few weeks left in office, 71% now approve of his job performance. This is slightly lower than it was in early 2013, but represents a significant improvement in his ratings from late 2013 and throughout 2014, when only about half of Hispanics approved of his job performance.
Whites have consistently expressed lower approval of Obama than blacks and Hispanics, but the share saying they approve also increased this year. About half (49%) of whites now say they approve of Obama, up from just 35% last December.
