People in Latin America also strongly support the U.S. ending its trade embargo against Cuba, which U.S. President Barack Obama has pledged to do, but would need congressional approval to move forward. Overall, a median of 76% across five Latin American countries support the lifting of the embargo, while only 13% oppose such an action.
Support for the U.S. removing the embargo, as with re-establishing diplomatic ties, is strongest in Argentina (79%), Chile (77%) and Venezuela (76%). Majorities of Brazilians (71%) and Mexicans (55%) also endorse the ending of the embargo, which would allow U.S. companies to do business in Cuba and Cuban companies to seek profit in the U.S.
