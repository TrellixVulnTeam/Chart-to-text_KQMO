While overall ratings for China among people around the world are mostly positive, that is not the case on the issue of individual liberty. A global median of 45% say the Chinese government does not respect the personal freedoms of its people, while only 34% say that it does. Citizens in the European Union and North America are most likely to hold this negative view. In Asia, publics are very divided on this issue, as are those in the Middle East. People in Africa are the most positive about Chinaâ€™s human rights record.
