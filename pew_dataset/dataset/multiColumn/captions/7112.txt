The internet tops the list (25%) when people are asked which source has been most useful. Close to four-in-ten (38%) of those younger than 40 cite the internet as that most useful source. Among those 40-64, the web is tied with the cable news networks (22%) and among those 65 and older, the most frequent choices are local television news (21%) and cable news (22%). Still, 15% of that group name the internet. The internet is the top choice – or tied for top choice – across income and education groups. Broken down a different way, of the 49% who say they learned something about the swine flu from the internet, about half (51%) say the internet was their most useful source. Among the 69% who say they learned about the flu from local TV news, just 23% cite local TV news as the most useful source. For cable news viewers, the pattern is similar. Of the two thirds (65%) that say they learned about the flu from cable TV news, just 22% cite cable TV news as the most useful source.
