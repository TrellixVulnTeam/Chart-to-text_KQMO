Japan has a median age of 48 – more than 17 years above the global figure – and about a third of its inhabitants (34%) are 60 or older. In South Korea, another economically advanced country, the median age is 44 and nearly a quarter of the population (23%) is 60 or older. Both countries have very low fertility and unusually high life expectancies. And even though both countries have recently reported a “second wave” of coronavirus cases, the fatality rates there so far have been relatively low.
