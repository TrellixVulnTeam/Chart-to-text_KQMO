Democrats are somewhat more likely than Republicans to express support for journalists’ use of anonymous sources, though majorities of both parties think they are acceptable, at least in moderation. Roughly nine-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (92%) say that it is acceptable for journalists to use anonymous sources, as do about seven-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (71%). But like Americans overall, most in each party say anonymous sources should be used only in special cases.
While fewer in each party say it is always acceptable to rely on anonymous sources, Democrats are about three times as likely as Republicans to say this (22% vs. 8%). The relationship is nearly the inverse for the feeling that anonymous sources should be forbidden. Nearly three-in-ten Republicans (29%) think that it is never acceptable to use anonymous sources – 21 percentage points higher than Democrats who say the same (8%).
