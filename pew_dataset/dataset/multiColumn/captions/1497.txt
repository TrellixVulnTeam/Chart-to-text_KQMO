Canada resettled more refugees than the United States in 2018, the first time the U.S. did not lead the world on this measure since the adoption of the Refugee Act in 1980, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of new data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
The sharp drop in U.S. refugee resettlement is in part due to the Trump administration’s decision to set a considerably lower cap on the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. than in previous years. In the U.S., the number of refugees admitted for resettlement is set by the president.
Until 2017, the U.S. resettled more refugees each year than the rest of the world’s countries combined. Since 1980, the U.S. has resettled millions more refugees than other countries – a total of about 3 million. The next two countries, Canada (658,000) and Australia (486,000), have resettled fewer than a million each over the same period.
