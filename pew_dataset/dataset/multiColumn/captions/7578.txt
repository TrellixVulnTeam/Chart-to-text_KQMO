A one-party surge in the Democratic vote in 2006 or a one-party collapse in the Republican vote is unlikely, given the GOP’s recent success at voter mobilization. More likely is an increased vote for both parties, with the Republicans hoping to keep the nationwide House tally as close to 50-50 as possible. That is what happened from 1996 through 2000, as the nationwide congressional vote between the two parties was virtually even each time and the GOP retained control of the House.
The GOP’s ultimate ace in the hole is that they approach Nov. 7 as the reigning champions of voter turnout. In 2002, the Republican House vote increased by more than 5 million from 1998, compared with a Democratic gain of barely 2 million. In 2004, President Bush gained more than 11 million votes from 2000, compared with an increase for Democrat John Kerry of barely 8 million over Al Gore’s tally four years earlier.
