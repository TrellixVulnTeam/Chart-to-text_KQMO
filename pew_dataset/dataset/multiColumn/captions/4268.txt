The immigrants who have recently come to the United States are the most highly educated in history. A new Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data shows that 41% of immigrants arriving here in the past five years had completed at least a bachelorâ€™s degree. By comparison, only 20% of newly arrived immigrants in 1970 were similarly educated.
