The rate from March 2007 to April 2008 was 17%; this compares to the 12% growth rate from March 2006 to March 2007. It is also worth noting that the April 2008 number for broadband adoption at home is little changed from the 54% figure from the Pew Internet Projectâ€™s December 2007 survey. With growth in broadband at home, now just 10% of Americans have dial-up internet connections at home.
