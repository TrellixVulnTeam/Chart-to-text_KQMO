In a survey conducted in April, after the Boston bombings, 75% of Americans agreed with the statement “occasional acts of terrorism in the U.S. will be part of life in the future.” While majorities consistently have held that view over the past decade, the post-Boston number was a significant increase from 64% who held this view in 2012, and matched the previous high of 74% in 2003.
