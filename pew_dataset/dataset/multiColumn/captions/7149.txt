The public continues to pay attention to economic and financial news, including last week’s big rise in the stock market. More than a quarter of Americans (27%) say they followed reports about the condition of the U.S. economy more closely than any other story last week. Another 17% say they followed changes in the stock markets most closely, making those stories the two most closely followed of the week. Meanwhile, reporting about the economy took up 33% of the newshole, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). (Including stock market-related stories, economic coverage totaled 35% of all coverage.)
