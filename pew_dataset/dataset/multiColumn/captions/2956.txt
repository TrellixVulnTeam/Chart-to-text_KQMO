More than half of smartphone owners say they get news alerts on their phones, but few get these alerts frequently. Some 55% of smartphone owners say they ever get news alerts on their phones’ screens, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center survey. However, few users say they receive these types of alerts often, with just 13% of smartphone owners reporting doing this.
While smartphones are becoming more integrated into our lives, many users aren’t taking the necessary steps to secure their devices. A 2016 Pew Research Center survey found that 28% of U.S. smartphone owners say they do not use a screen lock or other features to secure their phone. Although a majority of smartphone users say they have updated their phone’s apps or operating system, around four-in-ten say they only update when it’s convenient for them. But some smartphone users forgo updating their phones altogether: 14% say they never update their phone’s operating system, while 10% say they don’t update the apps on their phone.
