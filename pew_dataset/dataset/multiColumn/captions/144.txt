For example, Europeans with favorable views of right-wing populist parties are less likely to say most people can be trusted. In France, just three-in-ten supporters of the National Rally party say people can be trusted, compared with 55% of those with an unfavorable opinion of the party. In the Netherlands, supporters of two populist parties, Party for Freedom (PVV) and the Forum for Democracy (FvD), are also less likely to say most people can be trusted.
