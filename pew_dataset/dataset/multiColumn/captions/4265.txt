The shorter tenures of today’s Republican class continue a congressional experience gap between GOP lawmakers and Democrats, which has persisted since the 1960s and widened after the 2010 elections.
Current House Republicans have served an average of 4.6 terms – almost as short a period as following the 1994 elections, when a wave of Republican first-termers gave the party control of the House for the first time in 40 years. Meanwhile, House Democrats now average 6.7 terms in office, among the most for the party over the past century.
