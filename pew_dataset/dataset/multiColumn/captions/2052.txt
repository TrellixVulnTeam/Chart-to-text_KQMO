When it comes to why a person is rich, the public overall is divided: 43% of U.S. adults say it is more because they worked harder than most other people, while 42% say it is more because they had greater advantages in life than most other people. Again, the two partisan coalitions have strikingly different views on this question.
About seven-in-ten Republicans (71%) say a person is generally more likely to be rich because they worked harder than others, and just 18% say a personâ€™s wealth is more likely to be the result of having more advantages in life. By contrast, just 22% of Democrats say wealth is generally more likely to be the result of working harder, while 62% say it generally has more to do with advantages others did not have.
