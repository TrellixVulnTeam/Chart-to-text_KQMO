In addition to the Cain allegations, most Americans say they heard at least a little last week about large banks abandoning plans to charge monthly fees for using debit cards to shop (46% a lot, 33% a little). Far fewer had heard about the arrest of four older men in Georgia on charges that they were planning a terror attack involving the poison ricin. Just 8% had heard a lot about this story, 30% had heard a little. About six-in-ten (61%) had heard nothing at all about this.
