A survey this summer found that women are much more likely than men to say gender discrimination is a major problem in the technology industry (44% vs. 29%). And when asked about race-related biases, 64% of blacks and 50% of Hispanics said discrimination against blacks and Hispanics is a major problem in the tech industry. By comparison, just 21% of whites said this is a major problem.
