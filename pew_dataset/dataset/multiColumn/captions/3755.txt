To look at these results more systematically, we created an index that combines responses from these characteristics. The index ranges from 0 to 6, where 0 is the most negative view of Americans and 6 is the most positive view of Americans. Those with more positive views of Americans are scored as 4 or above and those with more negative views of Americans are scored as 2 or below (3 is considered neutral). We then took the percentage of people above or below 3 in each country to create a scale of perceptions of the American people.
