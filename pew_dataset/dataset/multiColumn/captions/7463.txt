Events in Iraq were by far the most closely followed news story of the week. One-in-four Americans (24%) said this was the story they followed more closely than any other, greater than twice the number citing any other story listed.
The Iraq policy debate in Washington also captured substantial public attention while finishing first (17%) in terms of news coverage. For 9% of Americans, this was the story they followed most closely. The significant amount of coverage devoted to the president’s unannounced visit to Iraq and discussions leading up to the Iraq progress report from Gen. David Petraeus contributed to the story’s prominence in the news.
