As the two largest Spanish-language television networks in the U.S., Univision and Telemundo are key providers of news for Spanish speakers. Univision’s average audience – measured as the average number of TVs tuned to a program throughout a period of time – declined for all three national time slots studied: a 12% decline for the evening news time slot (4 p.m. to 7 p.m.), to an average audience of about 1 million; a 14% decline in late night news (11 p.m. to 2 a.m.); and an 11% decline for the morning news time slot (6 a.m. to 9 a.m.). Telemundo’s audience, on the other hand, increased by 7% in the evening news time slot, to an audience of about 700,ooo, and remained roughly steady at just under 400,000 for late night news.
