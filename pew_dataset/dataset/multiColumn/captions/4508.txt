Last July, just over 1.2 million teens worked in the retail sector, compared with more than 2 million in July 2000 – a 40.6% drop. Retail accounted for 24% of teen summer jobs in 2000 but only 21.7% last year. (Among all workers, by comparison, retail employment was about 1% higher last July than it was in July 2000.)
Instead, teens are more likely to be working at hotels, restaurants and similar businesses. Nearly a third (32.2%) of employed teens last summer worked in the “accommodation and food services” sector, compared with 22.6% in July 2000. (The actual number in this sector fell a bit, from 1.9 million to 1.8 million, but they now make up a bigger share of a smaller total.)
Up modestly was the “arts, entertainment and recreation” sector, in which 8.8% of employed teens worked last July, versus 7.5% in 2000. But manufacturing and construction both were down, to 4.2% and 3.9%, respectively, of teen summer employment. A combined 450,000 teens worked in manufacturing or construction last July, less than half the combined number in July 2000.
