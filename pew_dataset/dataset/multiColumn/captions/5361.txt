While coal is still the single largest fuel source for U.S. power plants, its share has declined sharply in recent years, as older coal-fired plants have been shuttered in favor of newer plants fueled by natural gas. Last year, 39% of U.S. electricity was generated by coal, down from nearly half a decade earlier (though coal has regained a bit of that market share recently). By 2035, natural gas will surpass coal as the largest source of U.S. electricity generation, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration projections.
One reason electricity generators are switching to natural gas is that it produces far less carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas, than coal does. Coal accounted for nearly three-quarters of all power generation-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2012, despite generating about 40% of the nationâ€™s electricity, according to the EIA. Natural gas accounted for nearly all the remaining generation-related carbon dioxide.
