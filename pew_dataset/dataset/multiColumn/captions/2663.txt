Roughly half of both Republicans and Republican leaners (47%) and Democrats and Democratic leaners (46%) say the campaign against ISIS has not made much of a difference when it comes to terrorist attacks on American soil. However, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say the military campaign has increased the chances of a terrorist attack in the U.S. (33% vs. 18%), while Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say the campaign against ISIS has decreased the chances of a terrorist attack (32% vs. 18%).
