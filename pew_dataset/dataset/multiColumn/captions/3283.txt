The increasing number of minorities in Congress is due largely to changes in the House, where today 95 of 435 members (22%) are nonwhite, according to CQ Roll Call. By comparison, there were 60 minorities in the House in 2001. In the Senate, 10 of 100 members now belong to a racial or ethnic minority group, up from three in 2001.
