Democratsâ€™ views are little changed over this period. In the January survey, 56% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say world problems would be worse without U.S. involvement.
Younger Americans are more likely to say that U.S. involvement in the world usually makes problems worse compared with those 50 and older. Those under 30 are about evenly divided with 43% saying that U.S. involvement usually makes problems worse, and 50% saying that things would be even worse without U.S. involvement.
