There is less division among Democrats than in the past on the issues of immigration, same-sex marriage and racial equality. A decade ago, there was more significant disagreement among Democrats over these issues, with the party nearly evenly split. Today, three-quarters of Democrats or more are in agreement on these issues.
In 2009, about half of Democrats (52%) said immigrants “strengthen our country because of their hard work and talents.” Earlier this year, 83% of Democrats said immigrants did more to strengthen than burden the country.
A similar shift has occurred on same-sex marriage and views of the state of racial equality. In 2009, Democrats were divided in their views of same-sex marriage; today, three-quarters favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally.
Over the same period, the share of Democrats who say the country needs to continue making changes to give blacks equal rights with whites has increased from 57% to 83%.
