Today’s parents take a wide range of actions to monitor and police their teen’s online behavior. Nearly six-in-ten parents say they often or sometimes check which websites their teen visits or look through their child’s cellphone call logs or messages (58% of parents say they do each of these things). A somewhat smaller share of parents (52%) say they at least sometimes use parental controls to restrict which sites their teen can access.
