Younger adult Americans consume more digital video and digital news video than older ones. Nearly half of adults ages 18 to 29 watch online news video. That substantially outpaces that of older Americans. And it stands in contrast with surveys showing that when it comes to television news viewing habits, 18-29 year-olds tend to watch less than any other age group.
More highly educated and wealthier Americans are more likely to watch digital news video. Slightly more than half of Americans with a bachelor or graduate degree from college (52%) watch news video online. This is moderately higher than the video news viewing of those who completed some college (43%) and more than double the rate of those with a high school degree or less (22%). In addition, Americans who earn more than $75,000 a year in household income are more likely watch news videos online.
