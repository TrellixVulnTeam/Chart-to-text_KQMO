One way to insure that an individual’s desires about end-of-life medical care are carried out is to put them in writing. Nearly all Americans know what a “living will” is, and most have given at least some thought to their own wishes regarding medical treatment at the end of their life. In the 2005 Pew Research survey, 35% said they’ve given this a great deal of thought and 36% said they’ve given it some thought. Even so, only 27% said they have put their wishes in writing and 29% said they have a living will. Though, this represented a significant increase from 1990 when even fewer — 12% — had some sort of living will. Not surprisingly, older people are more likely than young people to have thought about these issues and to have formalized their wishes. Half of those ages 65 and older (51%) say their wishes for medical treatment are written down and 54% say they have a living will.
