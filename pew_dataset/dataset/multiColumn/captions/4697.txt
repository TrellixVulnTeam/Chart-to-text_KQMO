While mobile networks in sub-Saharan Africa have spread rapidly, landline penetration in the seven countries surveyed is close to zero. A median of only 2% across these nations say they have a working landline telephone in their house, with a median of 97% saying they do not have one. There is little variation across the countries on landline ownership. Landlines are simply rare on the continent. By contrast, 60% of Americans have a landline telephone in their household. (However, the share of wireless-only households in the U.S. has been growing rapidly over the past decade as landline ownership falls.)
