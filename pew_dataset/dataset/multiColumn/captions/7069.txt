With Congress wrapping up work for its August recess, much of the coverage of the health care debate shifted to the town hall meetings last week. Health care maintained its spot atop the media’s agenda for the third straight week, though coverage was down slightly, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism.
The story accounted for 16% of the newshole, down from 19% the previous week and 25% the week before that. Meanwhile, four-in-ten Americans say they followed health care news very closely last week, down from the 47% that said the same the week before.
