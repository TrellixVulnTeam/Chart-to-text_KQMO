The Japanese public sees cybersecurity, ISIS and climate change as the biggest threats to their country.
About seven-in-ten Japanese (71%) say cyberattacks from other countries are a major threat to Japan. Roughly the same share of the public (69%) believes the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria known as ISIS represents a major threat. And a similar number (68%) cite global climate change as a major problem. Notably, it is older Japanese (75% of those ages 50 and older), not younger ones (59% ages 18 to 34), who are the most worried about global warming.
Despite widespread antipathy toward Beijing, a smaller share of the public (63%) names Chinaâ€™s emergence as a world power as a major threat to Japan. And despite a largely favorable view of the United States, roughly half the Japanese public (52%) also names U.S. power and influence as a major international challenge for Japan. Young Japanese (63%), those ages 18 to 34, are more likely than those ages 50 and older (47%) to see the U.S. as a threat.
