There is increasing public concern that the war is not going well, which undoubtedly underlies public reservations over troop commitments. By late August, amid reports of the Taliban’s resurgence and increasing U.S. troop fatalities, Gallup found that by a 38%-to-61% margin the public judged the war to be going badly; as recently as July that margin had been reversed with 54% saying well and 43% saying badly. A September CBS News/New York Times poll found a similar 35%-53% positive-negative split on the war’s progress.
