In a Pew Research Center survey conducted in the spring of 2012, 58% of teachers said they had their students write short essays, short responses, or opinion pieces at least once a week. A quarter of teachers only made these assignments monthly and another 10% made them less often than that, with 7% making no writing assignments at all.
The next most frequent writing assignment, reported by 41% of teachers, was to ask students to write in a journal at least once a week.
But when it comes to lengthy writing assignments, science and math teachers lag behind. Fully 94% of English teachers and 83% of history/social studies teachers had their students write a research paper during the 2011-2012 academic year, compared with 68% of science teachers and 36% of math teachers. A similar pattern emerges for multimedia or mixed media assignments, with English (84%) and history/social studies (82%) teachers most likely and math teachers least likely (51%) to have given their students this type of assignment in the prior academic year. Science teachers (70%) fall in the middle.
