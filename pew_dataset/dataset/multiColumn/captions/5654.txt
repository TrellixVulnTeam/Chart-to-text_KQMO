In addition, a growing share of Americans today are worried that government anti-terrorism programs are infringing on civil liberties. In the Pew Research survey, 44% said the government’s policies have gone too far in restricting the civil liberties of average people, up from 27% in January 2010. By contrast, 39% said in the latest survey that they were mainly concerned that government policies haven’t gone far enough to protect the country, down from 58% who said that in January 2010.
