When it comes to how men view themselves, about three-in-ten (31%) say they are very manly or masculine, 54% describe themselves as somewhat masculine and 15% say they are not too or not at all masculine. Again, race is linked to views about this: 49% of black men consider themselves to be very masculine, compared with 34% of Hispanic men and 28% of white men. Views also vary by party, with Republican men more likely than Democratic men to describe themselves as very masculine (39% vs. 23%).
