Large majorities of postgraduates (74%) and four-year college graduates (68%) say the U.S. should take allies’ interests into account. About half of those with some college education (52%) and 44% of those with a high school education or less agree.
Whites without a college degree are about equally divided between compromising with allies (48%) and following U.S. national interests when allies disagree (45%). College-educated whites largely favor taking into account allies’ interests and compromising when necessary (70% say this).
