Concern about air pollution has grown sharply in recent years, according to a Pew Research Center survey from this past spring. In that survey, 47% of Chinese said air pollution was a “very big” problem facing the country, up from 31% in 2008 and 36% last year. Air pollution ranked fourth out of 15 issues in terms of public concern, behind rising prices (which 59% of people cited as a very big problem), corrupt officials (53%) and the gap between rich and poor (52%).
