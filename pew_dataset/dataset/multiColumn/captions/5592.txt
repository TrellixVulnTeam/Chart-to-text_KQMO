The 2012 data on college entry by race and ethnicity show a striking convergence: After decades of marked disparities in enrollment, about two-thirds of white, black and Hispanic high school completers all were enrolled in college. (Enrollment among Asians continued to far outpace other groups.) But significant differences remain in completing high school: As of the 2009-10 academic year, the average freshman graduation rate in U.S. public high schools was 93.5% for Asian/Pacific Islanders, 83% for whites, 71.4% for Hispanics and 66.1% for blacks.
