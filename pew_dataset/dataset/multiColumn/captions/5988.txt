Costner’s fellow Southerners are among the strongest critics of the Supreme Court’s rulings on school prayer. More than seven-in-ten people (73%) living in the South say they disapprove of the high court’s decisions on the topic in the 2012 GSS. But many in Costner’s generation have a different view. Nationwide, about 56% of those ages 18-29 say they approve of the ban on school prayer – by far the highest share of any age group.
