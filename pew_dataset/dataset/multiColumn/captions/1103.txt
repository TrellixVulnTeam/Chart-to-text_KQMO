Trump’s key foreign policies are unpopular. When asked in the spring and summer of 2019 about six of Trump’s key foreign policies, people around the world largely expressed disapproval. They are especially critical of his tariff policy and the withdrawal from climate change agreements such as the Paris Agreement.
Trump’s immigration policies, including his well-known plans to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, are also unpopular, with a few exceptions in Central and Eastern Europe and Israel. People also see Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear weapons agreement negatively but are more positive about his negotiations with Kim Jong Un over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. (The survey was conducted prior to the Jan. 3, 2020, U.S. missile strike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani.)
Trump’s restrictions on immigration are more popular among those who support right-wing populist parties in Europe. When asked whether they approve of Trump’s policy to allow fewer immigrants in the U.S., people who support National Rally in France, Alternative for Germany (AfD) in Germany and Sweden Democrats in Sweden are at least 40 percentage points more likely than nonsupporters to express approval. This stark difference between populist supporters and non-populist supporters appears in many European countries and extends to opinions about Trump himself, as well as to his policy of building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
