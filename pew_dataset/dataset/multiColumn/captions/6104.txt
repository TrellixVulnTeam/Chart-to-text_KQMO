The already considerable amount of time devoted to sports, weather and traffic on local newscasts rose even higher among the stations studied in the Pew Research Center’s latest State of the News media report. Airtime on those subjects increased from 32% 2005 to 40% in 2012. The biggest increase came in the airtime devoted to sports, to 12% from 7%. The traffic and weather components of the newscast increased by a smaller percentage (to 29% from 25%), but four in ten of the newscasts examined in the study led with a weather story.
The topics people seek out the most on local TV news — weather and breaking news (and to a lesser extent, traffic) — are ripe for replacement by any number of Web- and mobile-based outlets. While many stations ramped up their digital news offerings in the past year, they are late to the digital game.
