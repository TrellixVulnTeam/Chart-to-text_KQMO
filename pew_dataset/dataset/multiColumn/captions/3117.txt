Views about environmental regulations are more partisan today than they were a decade ago. Roughly six-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners (58%) said in another 2016 Pew Research Center survey that environmental laws and regulations cost too many jobs and hurt the economy, up from 34% in 2007. By comparison, a declining share of Democrats and Democratic leaners hold this view. This partisan gap now stands at 41 percentage points; in 2007, it was 10 points.
