NPRâ€™s digital platforms continue to be an important part of its reach. The NPR One app, which offers a stream of individual shows and podcasts, had a similar or slightly higher average number of total completed sessions in 2018 as in 2017, depending upon the device. (A completed session is any instance in which a user starts and stops using the app.) The NPR News app, which offers livestreams from individual stations and digital content, declined in completed sessions among Android and iPad users. (Data for the NPR News iPhone app is unavailable for 2018.)
