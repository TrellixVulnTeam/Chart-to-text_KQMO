In radio, women make up the same percentage of managers (19.3%), the RTDNA 2012 survey reported. But the trajectory over time has been bumpier. The proportion of women in radio management has been relatively stable the last three years, but represents a decline from 2008, when one-quarter of the general managers were women.
The percentage of female managers at daily newspapers has remained stagnant for years. In 1998, 33.8% of newspaper supervisors were women; in 2012, 34.6% were, according to the American Society of News Editors, which conducts an annual newsroom census. The ASNE, which released its latest census last week, does not document the percentage of newspaper executive editors who are women, but a look at the 10 largest newspapers (based on weekday print and digital circulation) suggests the numbers would not be large. Among these newspapers, only The New York Times has a female executive editor: Jill Abramson, who in 2011 became the first woman to head The Times since its founding in 1851.
Outside the news industry, the proportion of women in managerial roles varies greatly. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (pdf) found that, in 2012, women made up the majority of human resource managers (72.7%), social service managers (70.5%), public relations and fundraising managers (69.3%) and education administrators (64.4%). But they comprise only 10.9% of architectural and engineering managers and 6.4% of construction managers.
