Yet, despite her low approval ratings, the president is viewed more favorably than her main challengers in the October election, who remain less well known. Roughly half (51%) have a favorable opinion of Rousseff, who represents the Workers’ Party (PT), about double the share that say the same about Aécio Neves (27%), the candidate of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB), or Eduardo Campos (24%) of the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB). All three candidates have unfavorable ratings hovering around the 50% mark. Roughly one-in-four do not offer an opinion of Rousseff’s challengers.
