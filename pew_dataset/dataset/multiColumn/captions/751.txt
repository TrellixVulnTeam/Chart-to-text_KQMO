Views on this question vary by respondents’ religious affiliation. Among white evangelical Protestants themselves, most feel that the Trump administration has had a positive impact on their affairs. About six-in-ten (59%) say that the administration has helped evangelicals, while only 7% say it has hurt them. Jews (64%) are about as likely to say the Trump administration has helped evangelical Christians, while black Protestants (21%) are least likely to say this.
The effects of Trump’s presidency on Muslims, on the other hand, are widely perceived to be negative. Americans are about seven times more likely to say that the Trump administration has hurt Muslims as they are to say it has helped them (48% vs. 7%).
Views on whether the Trump administration has helped or hurt Jews are more divided. The share of U.S. adults who say the administration has helped Jews (29%) is roughly equal to the share who say it has hurt them (26%), while about four-in-ten U.S. adults (42%) say the administration has not made much of a difference for Jews.
