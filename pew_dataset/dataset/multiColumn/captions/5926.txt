A Pew Research Center survey conducted in collaboration with Carnegie Endowment for International Peace last year found that 56% of Americans said it’s “very important” for the U.S. to be tough with China on economic and trade issues, and 52% said China’s emergence as a world power constituted a major threat to the United States. At the same time, 55% of the U.S. public said building a strong relationship with China should be a top priority, and nearly two-thirds (65%) said U.S.-China relations were “very” or “somewhat” good.
