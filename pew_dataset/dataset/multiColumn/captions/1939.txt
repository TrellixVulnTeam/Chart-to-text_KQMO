Americans and Germans have different views toward tariffs. In June 2018, the Trump administrationâ€™s tariffs on European steel and aluminum went into effect. In response, Germany and its European Union allies placed tariffs on American goods, ranging from bourbon to motorcycles. In the U.S., more Americans oppose than support the initial tariffs imposed on German and other EU products (51% vs. 44%). Germans, however, support retaliatory tariffs by a large margin: Nearly eight-in-ten (78%) support increasing tariffs on imported U.S. products in response to American tariffs on German goods.
