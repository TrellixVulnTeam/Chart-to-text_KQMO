By comparison, assessments are less positive among Cubans and Puerto Ricans. Among Cubans, 38% say the impact of unauthorized immigration is positive, but 28% say the impact is negative and 27% say there is no impact one way or the other. Among Puerto Ricans, roughly equal shares say the impact of unauthorized immigration on U.S. Hispanics is positive (34%), negative (29%) or has no effect (29%).
Spanish-dominant Hispanics are positive about the impact of unauthorized immigrants on the Hispanic community with 55% saying their impact is positive. By contrast, opinions are split among English-dominant Hispanics—31% see a positive effect of unauthorized immigration, 30% see a negative effect and 33% say there is no impact one way or the other.
Educational attainment is also linked to views of unauthorized immigration’s effect on Latinos already living in the U.S. Half (52%) of Latinos who have less than a high school diploma and half (48%) of Latinos who are high school graduates say the impact of unauthorized immigration on U.S. Latinos is positive. By contrast, among Latinos with a bachelor’s degree, views are not as positive. Just one-third (34%) say the effect of unauthorized immigration is positive, 33% say it is negative and 27% say there has been no effect.
