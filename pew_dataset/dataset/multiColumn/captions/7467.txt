For first two years of the conflict, Americans largely believed that the war effort was going at least fairly well and that the U.S. should not with draw its troops until the situation in Iraq was stable. By October 2005, however, a 53%-majority of the public had come to the view that the U.S. military effort in Iraq was not succeeding.
As judgments about the war worsened in the following months and years, calls for withdrawals also trended upward. By July of this year, a Pew poll found nearly six-in-ten Americans saying that the U.S. military effort in Iraq was going not too well or not at all well. Correspondingly, the poll found a 54%-39% margin in favor of bringing U.S. forces home. The obvious question is: given these trend lines, can enough of a case for progress be made by the Bush administration to revive public patience with the war effort literally overnight?
