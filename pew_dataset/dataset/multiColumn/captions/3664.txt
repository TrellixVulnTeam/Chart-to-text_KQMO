Few Americans trust social media as a news source. Only about two-in-ten Americans (22%) trust the information they get from local news organizations a lot, whether online or offline, and just 18% say the same of national organizations. But large majorities say they have at least some trust in both. This is not the case for social media, however. Only 4% of web-using adults have a lot of trust in the information they find on social media, and just 34% say they trust it at least some.
