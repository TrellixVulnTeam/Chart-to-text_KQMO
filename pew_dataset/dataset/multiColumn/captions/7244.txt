Bleak views of national economic conditions are increasingly held across party lines. At the time of the 2006 mid-term elections, the condition of the economy was a partisan issue with 70% of Republicans calling conditions excellent or good compared with only a quarter (25%) of Democrats. Republicans have soured on the economy over the past two years; the share of Republicans rating economic conditions as excellent/good has fallen from 70% in November 2006, to 46% in September 2007, to 14% today. As a result, the party gap on this issue has steadily diminished.
