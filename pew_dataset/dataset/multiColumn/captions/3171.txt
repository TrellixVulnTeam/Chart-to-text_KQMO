Older Republicans offer considerably different views than their younger counterparts. Four-in-ten Republicans ages 65 or older say fathers shouldnâ€™t be able to take leave from work following the birth or adoption of a child, compared with 20% of Republicans ages 50 to 64, 10% of those 30 to 49, and 14% of those 18 to 29. Age differences are relatively small among Democrats.
