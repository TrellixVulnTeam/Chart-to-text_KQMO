Generally, those who say they are worn out are more likely to say there is too much coverage of every topic compared with those who like seeing a lot of coverage of the election.
On one topic a notable party difference emerges in whether there is too much or too little coverage: experience. Roughly half (53%) of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say that there has been too little coverage of the candidatesâ€™ experience, compared with only about a third (36%) of Republicans and Republican leaners. No other topic differed by more than 6% in whether each is covered too much or too little.
