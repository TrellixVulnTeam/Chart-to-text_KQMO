The percentage of adults who use social networking sites is determined in part by the prevalence of internet use, which is more broadly connected to a countryâ€™s wealth. The scatter plot below shows the positive relationship between GDP per capita (PPP) in the country and the level of social networking.
The U.S., which has the highest per capita GDP among the countries surveyed, is also among the countries with the highest percentage of adults using social networking sites, while Pakistan and India have two of the lowest per capita GDPs and the lowest levels of social networking.
