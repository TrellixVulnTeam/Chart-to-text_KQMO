But Americans and Japanese differ on Japanâ€™s role in regional security. Seven decades after the end of World War II, the American public is divided over whether Japan should play a more active military role in helping to maintain peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region: 47% would like to see Tokyo take a more active role and 43% would prefer that Japan limit its role. Americans who trust Japan also say they want Tokyo to play a greater strategic role in the region. And Americans who do not trust China say they want Japan to take on more of the military burden in Asia.
