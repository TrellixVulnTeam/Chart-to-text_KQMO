Muslims around the world are set to mark Ramadan, a holy month when many fast from sunrise to sunset in order to focus on their spiritual life and get closer to God. In the United States, the vast majority of Muslims celebrate Ramadan, with eight-in-ten saying they fast during the holiday.
Fasting for Ramadan is common across all the demographic groups that make up Americaâ€™s 2.15 million Muslim adults. For instance, similar shares of Muslim men and women (77% vs. 82%) say they fast, and there is little difference between Muslims who were born in the U.S. and immigrants (79% vs. 80%).
