In ceremonies today led by Secretary of State John Kerry, the flag was raised at the U.S. Embassy in Havana for the first time since 1961, signifying a re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba. Although this renewal has its critics, people across five Latin American nations surveyed in spring of this year approve of the neighboring countries restoring relations, and the American public also overwhelmingly supports this approach.
Nearly three-quarters of Americans (73%) say they approve of the U.S. renewing ties with Cuba. A similar median of 77% across five Latin American countries surveyed (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Venezuela) approve of this action. This includes 79% of Chileans, 78% of Argentines and 77% of Venezuelans. Brazilians (67% approve) and Mexicans (54%) are actually more skeptical of the deal than Americans, whose support has grown 10 percentage points since earlier this year.
Both Americans and Latin Americans also support the U.S. ending its trade embargo against Cuba. Roughly three-quarters in the U.S. (72%) and in Latin America (median of 76%) favor ending the embargo. Only in Mexico (55% support) is there less support for such an action.
