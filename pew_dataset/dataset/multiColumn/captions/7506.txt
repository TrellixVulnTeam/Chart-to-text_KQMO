While the national media divided its time last week among a host of major news stories, the public remained intensely focused on the situation in Iraq. Fully 36% of Americans paid very closely attention to events in Iraq and 35% said this was the news story they followed more closely than any other. Another 12% of the public listed the debate over Iraq policy as the story they followed most closely. News coverage of Iraq focused primarily on events on the ground, while the policy debate took a back seat. In previous weeks, the policy debate has received more media coverage than the situation in Iraq. However, dramatic events, including the capture of three American soldiers, altered the balance of coverage.
Interest in the 2008 presidential campaign has remained fairly consistent in recent weeks, even while the amount of coverage has fluctuated depending on campaign events and the demands of competing news stories. This past week 18% of the public followed campaign news very closely and another 31% followed it fairly closely. Roughly one-in-ten listed the campaign as their most closely followed story. For the first time since February, when Pew began tracking interest in the campaign, Republicans followed campaign news as closely as did Democrats (22% of both Republicans and Democrats paid very close attention to campaign news, as did 14% of independents). The news media had more to offer GOP loyalists this past week, as news of the Republican candidates outweighed news of the Democrats by a significant margin. Throughout most of the year, press coverage of the campaign has consistently focused more on the Democratic candidates.
