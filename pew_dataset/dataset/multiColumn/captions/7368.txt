An overwhelming majority of Americans (81%) are aware of news reports that John McCain may have had an improper relationship with a female lobbyist several years ago. About half (48%) of the public has heard a lot about this story, which first appeared in the New York Times late last week. Another 33% has heard at least a little about the story. By a nearly two-to-one margin those who have heard about the McCain story think the New York Times was wrong to publish it — 57% say the Times did the wrong thing in publishing the story, 33% say the paper did the right thing.
Republicans are only slightly more likely than Democrats to have heard about the McCain story (87% of Republicans have heard at least a little compared with 80% of Democrats). However, partisan views on the role of the New York Times differ dramatically. By a 75% to 16% margin Republicans who are aware of the story say the Times did the wrong thing by publishing it. Democrats are evenly split on the issue — 47% say the Times was wrong, 45% say the paper was right. Independents have a more negative view of the Times’ decision (55% wrong, 33% right).
