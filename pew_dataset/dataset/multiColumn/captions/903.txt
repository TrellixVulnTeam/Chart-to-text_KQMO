Most never-married users of online dating platforms say they are currently using one of these services or have recently done so. Around a third of online daters who have never been married (34%) – which translates to 18% of all never-married adults – say they are currently using a dating site or app. An additional 28% say they are not currently using an online dating service but have done so in the past year. About four-in-ten online daters who have never tied the knot say that the last time they used a dating site or app was either between one and five years ago or more than five years ago.
As one might expect, relatively few Americans who are married or living with a partner are currently active on dating platforms. Still, among those who say they have ever used an online dating platform, 5% of cohabiting and 3% of married people say they are currently using one of these services. That means 1% of all married adults and 2% of all cohabiting adults in the U.S. are current users of dating sites or apps.
