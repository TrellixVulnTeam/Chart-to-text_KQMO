About one-in-ten Americans (9%) did not learn about this year’s presidential election in a given week from any of 11 types of sources asked about in a January Pew Research Center survey. One striking trait of this group is their lack of faith in the impact of voting.
American adults ages 18 to 29 are more likely than any other age group to have not learned about the election. In total, 17% of them did not learn from any type of source, nearly double that of the next highest age group (though the vast majority of younger adults – 83% – did learn about the election). This corresponds to earlier research showing that younger adults tend to be more politically unengaged.
Those with more ideologically consistent views are more likely to have learned about the election than those who had ideologically mixed views. Of those with mixed views, 14% didn’t learn about the election from any source, which is higher than those who are more consistently liberal or conservative. Recent research has shown that political engagement is increasingly linked to ideological consistency; it follows that the 9% who did not learn about the election are both less engaged in the political process and more likely to have mixed ideological views.
