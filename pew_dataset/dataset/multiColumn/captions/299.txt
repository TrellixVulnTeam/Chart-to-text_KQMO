Few in the countries surveyed have confidence in the leader of either the U.S. or China, and many are critical of how both countries have handled the coronavirus outbreak. On most measures included in the survey, people are even more critical of the U.S. than of China – though more still have favorable opinions of the U.S.
Most people rate China more positively than the U.S. in its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Across the 14 countries surveyed, few praise China’s response to COVID-19, with a median of 37% saying it has done a good job dealing with the outbreak. But, in all countries except Japan and the U.S. itself, people are much more complimentary of China’s response than that of the U.S. In Japan, fewer than one-in-five praise either country. The gap is largest in Italy, where 51% say China has done a good job compared with 18% who say the same of the U.S., a difference of 33 percentage points. Gaps of around 30 points exist across most of the Western European countries surveyed.
