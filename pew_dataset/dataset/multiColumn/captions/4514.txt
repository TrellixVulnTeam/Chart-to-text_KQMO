Russian confidence in U.S. President Barack Obama has also collapsed in the past few years. Just 11% now say they have a lot or some confidence in Obama’s ability to handle international affairs, while 86% have little or no confidence. But Obama is not alone in falling out of Russian favor. Russian confidence in German Chancellor Angela Merkel and favorable views toward NATO, the EU and Germany all hit new lows in 2015. Meanwhile, our 2014 poll found 44% of Russians had confidence in Chinese President Xi Jinping, while 34% had no confidence and 22% had no opinion.
Russians clearly favor China over the U.S. on other measures, too. By a margin of 37% to 24%, Russians say that China, not the U.S., is the world’s leading economy. And 44% of Russians say that China either already has replaced or will replace the U.S. as the world’s leading superpower, while just 35% say this will never happen.
