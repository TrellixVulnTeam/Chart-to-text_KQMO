About seven-in-ten Americans (69%) say there’s solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in March. That’s about as many as said so in 2008, although acceptance of the reality of global warming has risen and fallen considerably over that time span: from a high of 79% in July 2006 to a low of 57% in October 2009.
But opinions vary on what’s causing the planet’s mean temperature to rise. Four in ten (42%) said it was primarily due to human activity, such as burning fossil fuels, while 23% attributed the warming to natural variations in climate patterns. Another 27% said there was no solid evidence of any warming.
