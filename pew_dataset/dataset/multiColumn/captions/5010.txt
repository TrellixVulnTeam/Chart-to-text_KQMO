For example, among those who have heard of CNN but did not get news there, expressions of trust and distrust are roughly equal â€“ 37% trust and 33% distrust. (Fully 80% of those who heard of it and consumed it say they trust it.) PBS, however (trusted by 84% of those who got news there in the past week), was roughly twice as trusted as distrusted outside its core audience (34% v. 16%).
