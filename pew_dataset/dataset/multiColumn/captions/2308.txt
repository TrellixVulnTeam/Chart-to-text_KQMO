Supporters of the two parties differ substantially in their views of immigrants and the benefits that they do – or do not – bring to Italian society. About three-quarters of Italians who identify with the League – which campaigned on a far-right platform focused on reducing immigration – say immigrants are a burden on the Italian economy because they take Italians’ jobs. About seven-in-ten League supporters also say immigrants increase the risk of terrorist attacks in Italy, including 59% who say they strongly believe immigrants increase the risk of such attacks.
Those who identify with Five Star – which focused less on the immigration issue during the campaign – are more divided and much more in line with the views of the rest of Italian society. Among Five Star supporters, 49% say immigrants are an economic burden, compared with 40% who say they make the economy stronger. And while a majority of Five Star backers (55%) say immigrants increase the risk of terrorism in their country, a sizable percentage (42%) say immigrants do not increase terror risks.
