In a sharp contrast from four years ago, a large majority of Republicans say their side has been winning more often than it has been losing politically, while Democrats overwhelmingly say their side has been on the losing end more frequently.
Today, 69% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say that on the issues that matter to them, their side has been winning more often than losing, according to a new Pew Research Center survey conducted Feb. 4-15 among 6,395 adults.
Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, just 18% think their side has been winning, while 80% say their side has been losing more often.
Among all adults, 56% say that on the issues that matter to them, their side has been losing more often than winning, while 41% say their side has been winning more often than losing. The share saying their side is losing more often than winning has declined 11 percentage points since 2018, largely because of the change among Republicans.
