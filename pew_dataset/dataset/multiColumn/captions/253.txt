Democrats outnumber Republicans among Hispanic registered voters in Florida, and this gap has widened since 2016. This year, about 948,000 Hispanic voters are registered as Democrats (amounting to about 38% of the Hispanic total in Florida), while roughly 640,000 are registered as Republicans (26% of the total). An additional 880,000 Hispanic Floridians are registered with no party affiliation (35% of the total).
This yearâ€™s Democratic advantage of around 308,000 Hispanic registered voters is up from an advantage of 284,000 four years ago. In 2016, 798,000 Hispanics in Florida were registered Democrats while 514,000 were registered Republicans.
