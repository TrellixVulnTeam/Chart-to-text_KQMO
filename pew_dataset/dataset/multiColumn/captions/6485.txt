While the public followed the debate about Obama’s jobs legislation more closely than any other news, they also closely followed news about new government estimates on the number of Americans living in poverty. Currently, an estimated 15.1% of the population – 46 million people – live in poverty, the highest share since 1993. About three-in-ten (31%) say they followed news about the debate in Washington over jobs legislation very closely, about the same as the 28% that say they followed news about the new poverty numbers that closely.
The number following the debate in Washington is comparable to the 28% that said they followed Obama’s speech about jobs to a joint session of Congress one week earlier. Three-in-ten women (31%) say they followed the news about poverty numbers very closely, compared with 24% of men. Democrats and Republicans express similar interest in this story (34% and 28% very closely, respectively).
About a quarter of Americans say they followed news about the 2012 candidates or the fluctuations in the stock market very closely (24% each). Partisans express comparable levels of interest in both stories. Interest in election news has been relatively steady since late August.
Fewer than two-in-ten (16%) each say they followed news about the European debt crisis or last week’s attack on the U.S. Embassy in Afghanistan very closely. News out of Afghanistan accounted for 6% of coverage.
