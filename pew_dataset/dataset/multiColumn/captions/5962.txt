Most Americans believe undocumented immigrants should meet certain requirements before they are allowed to stay in the U.S. legally: 56% say undocumented immigrants should have to pay fines before gaining legal status. A similar percentage (55%) backs a 10-year waiting period for most immigrants before permanent residency.
There is much broader support for another requirement â€“ fully 76% of the public, including majorities of nearly every demographic group, say that undocumented immigrants should have to show they can speak and understand English before being allowed to stay in the U.S. legally.
