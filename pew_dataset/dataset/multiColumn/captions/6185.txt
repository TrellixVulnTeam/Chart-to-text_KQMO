Support for same-sex marriage has been on the rise over the past 15 years. Across four Pew Research Center surveys this year, 48% of Americans say they favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally, while 43% are opposed. Just four years ago, in the 2008 election cycle, 51% opposed making same-sex marriages legal and 39% supported it.
While support has grown in all regions of the country, it is far stronger in some than in others. In New England, 62% favor same-sex marriage, while 29% oppose it. People in the South express greater opposition. A majority (56%) in the central Southern states such as Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas oppose same-sex marriage, while about a third (35%) favors it â€” amounting to a 27 percentage point difference compared with New England.
Attitudes toward gay marriage in the South are comparable to where the country as a whole was a decade ago.
