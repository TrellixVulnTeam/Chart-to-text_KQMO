But a closer look at the demographic patterns reveals some interesting insights about who is getting married. From 2011 to 2012, the total number of newly married adults increased by 113,000 (from 4.21 million to 4.32 million). Examining the newlyweds by education level, the number of newly married adults with at least a bachelorâ€™s degree increased by 98,000 from 2011 to 2012. Thus, almost the entire increase in new marriages (87%) from 2011 to 2012 is accounted for by the college-educated.
The new marriage rate among college-educated adults increased from 55.3 newlyweds per thousand eligible adults in 2011 to 56.7 newly married in 2012. In contrast, the new marriage rate among adults with some college education and adults with a high school diploma fell further from 2011 to 2012.
