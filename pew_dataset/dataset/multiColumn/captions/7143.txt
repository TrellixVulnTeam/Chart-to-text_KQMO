In early March, 66% of Democrats said that the country is headed in the right direction. That compared with 35% of independents and just 11% of Republicans. The partisan differences were much smaller in views of national satisfaction. Slightly more than a quarter of Democrats (27%) said they were satisfied with the way things are going, compared with 20% of independents and 11% of Republicans.
