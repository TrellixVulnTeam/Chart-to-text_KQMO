Roughly three-quarters (74%) of high-income Democrats had a favorable impression of the Fed, a view shared by just 40% of high-income Republicans (54% of whom viewed the Fed unfavorably).
Democrats with family incomes of between $75,000 and $150,000 also had broadly positive views of the Fed (66% favorable, 24% unfavorable), while Republican views were divided (44% vs. 45%).
Democrats with incomes of less than $30,000 felt less positively toward the Fed than did higher-income Democrats. Just 53% viewed it favorably, while 30% viewed it unfavorably. As a result, views among low- income households were not as polarized, but there was still a 13-percentage-point partisan difference in favorable views of the central bank (53% of Democrats vs. 40% of Republicans).
