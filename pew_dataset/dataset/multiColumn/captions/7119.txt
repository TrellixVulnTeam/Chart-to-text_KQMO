Looking at the individual monthly surveys since December suggests that both political parties are facing declining membership in the wake of an engaging election cycle. In the Pew Research Center’s April 2009 survey, 33% identified as Democrats, down from 39% in December 2008. Over the same period, the share calling themselves Republicans has fallen from 26% to 22%. By contrast, the number of independents has risen from 30% in December to 39% now. While it is not unusual for Republican and Democratic identification to grow over the course of an election and subside afterward, the magnitude of these changes is noteworthy.
In announcing his change in party affiliation from Republican to Democrat yesterday, Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter mentioned the changing composition of his state as a consideration. Across a typical year the Pew Research Center conducts well over 1,000 interviews in Pennsylvania, including 384 in the first four months of 2009. The data, so far, support Sen. Specter’s contention. When he last ran for his seat in 2004, 38% of Pennsylvanians said they were Democrats, while 34% identified as Republican. This year, the share identifying as Democrats is the same 38%, but only 27% call themselves Republicans. What had been a slim four-point Democratic identification advantage is now an eleven-point advantage.
