Current views mark a shift from April 2016. Two years ago, a 41% plurality said the U.S. did too much to solve global problems; fewer said the country did too little (27%) or about the right amount (28%).
Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, nearly half (48%) say the U.S. does too little to solve world problems, up from just 22% two years ago. There has been a 16-percentage-point decline in the share of Democrats who say the U.S. does too much to help solve world problems, and a 17-point decline in the share saying it does about the right amount.
Over the same period, the share of Republicans and Republican leaners who say the U.S. does the right amount to solve world problems has more than doubled (42% now, 17% then). However, nearly four-in-ten Republicans (37%) say the U.S. does too much to solve world problems, down from 45% in 2o16. The share of Republicans who say the U.S. does too little in this regard has fallen 17 percentage points (from 33% to 16%).
