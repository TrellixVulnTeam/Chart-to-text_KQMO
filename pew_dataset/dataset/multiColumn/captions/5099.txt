A majority of Tunisians (59%) now say they should rely on a leader with a strong hand to solve their country’s problems, up 19 percentage points in just a year. Roughly four-in-ten (38%) believe that a democratic form of government is the best solution to the mounting challenges Tunisia faces, a substantial decline from 2013 when more than half (53%) said democracy was the best way. Following Ben Ali’s ouster, 61% thought a democratic form of government was preferable to a strong leader.
