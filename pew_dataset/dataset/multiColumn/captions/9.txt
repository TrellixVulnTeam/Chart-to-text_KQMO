An estimated 2.3 million Hispanics of Salvadoran origin resided in the United States in 2017, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Salvadorans in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Salvadoran origin; this includes immigrants from El Salvador and those who trace their family ancestry to El Salvador.
Salvadorans are the third-largest population (tied with Cubans) of Hispanic origin living in the United States, accounting for 4% of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017. Since 2000, the Salvadoran-origin population has increased 225%, growing from 711,000 to 2.3 million over the period. At the same time, the Salvadoran foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew by 142%, from 539,000 in 2000 to 1.3 million in 2017. By comparison, Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, constituted 36.6 million, or 62%, of the Hispanic population in 2017.
