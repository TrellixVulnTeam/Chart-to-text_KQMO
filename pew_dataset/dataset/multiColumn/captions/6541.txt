A plurality of Americans (41%) say news organizations are giving the right amount of coverage to possible candidates for the 2012 elections, while 29% say they are giving too much coverage to election news.
That is up slightly from 22% in April. Another 16% say the press is giving too little coverage to the candidates.
Pluralities also say news organizations are giving the right amount of coverage to the situation in Afghanistan (42%) and news about the federal budget deficit and national debt (44%).
Relatively few see either story receiving too much coverage (12% Afghanistan, 11% federal budget deficit and national debt.)
