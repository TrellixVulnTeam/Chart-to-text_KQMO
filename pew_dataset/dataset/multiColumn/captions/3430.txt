Regardless of what they would like to see happen with the law, a growing share of Americans – across partisan lines – now see a dim future for the law’s major provisions. Roughly half of U.S. adults (53%) expect that its major provisions will probably be eliminated, while 39% say they are probably here to stay. About six-in-ten Republicans (63%) predict the ACA’s major provisions will be eliminated, while about a third (32%) expect them to stay. Democrats are more divided, however: 45% say major provisions are likely to stay, while a similar share (49%) expects they will be eliminated.
