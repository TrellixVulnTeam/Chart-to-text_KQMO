Among women, there is a significant age gap in views on this issue. A majority (60%) of women ages 65 and older say a woman should have children before entering politics, while only 30% of women ages 18 to 29 say the same. Instead, four-in-ten women ages 18 to 29 say women should wait until they’re well established in their political careers to have children. Just one-quarter of women 65 and older say this is the best choice.
Women’s views also differ by their level of education. About four-in-ten women without a four-year college degree (42%) say a woman has the best chance of success in politics if she has children early; 57% of women with a bachelor’s degree or higher say this. About one-third (32%) of less educated women, compared with 21% of college graduates, say a woman who wants to reach high political office should wait until she is well established in her career to have children.
Women who are mothers themselves have somewhat different views on this than women who don’t have young children. Mothers of children younger than 18 are more likely than other women to say a woman who aspires to high political office should wait until she’s established in her political career before having children. About one-third (36%) of mothers say a woman who wants to reach this type of position is better off waiting to have children, compared with 26% of those without children under 18.
