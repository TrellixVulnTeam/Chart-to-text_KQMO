On the issue of Ukraine, and what to do about Russian activities in the Crimea and eastern Ukraine, when asked if it is more important to be tough with Russia or to have a strong economic relationship with Moscow, half of Germans voice the view it is more important to be tough. In spite of Germanyâ€™s long-standing economic and energy ties with Russia, only about a third (35%) say a strong economic relationship is more important. Notably, younger Germans (53%), ages 18 to 29, are much more supportive of standing up to Russia over Ukraine than are older Germans (36%), ages 65 and older.
But Americans are much more supportive of taking action against Russia than are Germans. More than half of Americans (54%) believe that U.S. policy is not tough enough on Moscow. And 59% of Americans say the European Union is not being strong enough.
At the same time, roughly six-in-ten Germans (62%) think the U.S. position with regard to Russia is too tough (27%) or about right (35%). Similarly, 62% of Germans believe that EU actions against Russia are too strong (18%) or about right (44%).
