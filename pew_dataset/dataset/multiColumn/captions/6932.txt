More than four-in-ten say they followed news last week about the U.S. economy (43%) or the earthquake (42%) very closely. Just fewer than four-in-ten (38%) say they followed news about the earthquake aftermath more closely than any other major news story, while 26% say they followed news about the condition of the economy most closely.
By contrast, just about two-in-ten (21%) say they followed news about problems with sudden acceleration and braking in Toyota cars and trucks very closely. One-in-ten say this was the story they followed most closely last week, according to the latest News Interest Index survey, conducted Feb. 5-8 among 1,015 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press.
