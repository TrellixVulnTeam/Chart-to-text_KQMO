But when asked whether the U.S. owed its success more to its “ability to change” or its “reliance on long-standing principles,” 51% of Americans attributed its success to the ability to change, while 43% pointed to reliance on long-standing principles.
The question was one of many measures about the country and its future we examined for our 2015 survey on government performance. For most Millennials and Gen Xers, the country’s success was associated with its ability to change. About six-in-ten Millennials (62%), ages 18 to 34 in 2015, and 51% of Gen Xers (then ages 35 to 50) said the U.S. had been successful because of its ability to change.
Boomers (ages 51-69 at the time) were more divided: 45% said it was due to America’s ability to change while nearly the same share (49%) said it was due to its reliance on principles. Members of the Silent generation (ages 70-87) were also split: 43% said America has been successful because of its ability to change while 46% say it is due to its reliance on long-standing principles.
