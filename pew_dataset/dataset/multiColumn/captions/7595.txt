Gasoline and energy prices are far and away the most talked about issues among Americans today. Three-quarters say that it is a subject that comes up “frequently” in conversations with family and friends, and it is a topic of discussion among people of all walks of life and political persuasions. The economy, the war in Iraq, education, and health care are also frequent topics of conversation for most Americans.
Far fewer have regular conversations about government corruption, Social Security or the environment, and just 14% say the topic of gay marriage comes up frequently.
