Although TV remained the most popular source for election news, a growing share of voters opted to supplement their TV viewing by “dual-screening” with online sources: 37% of voters who followed the election returns used both television and the web, up from 27% in 2012. Conversely, the share of voters who followed the election results only on television fell by 14 points (from 65% to 51%). And although relatively few voters who tracked the returns said they did so only on the internet, that share has nearly doubled since 2012: This year, around one-in-ten voters who followed the returns (11%) did so only online.
