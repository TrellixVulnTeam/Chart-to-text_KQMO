By a 54% to 34% margin, more Americans say the priority for addressing the nationâ€™s energy supply should be developing alternative energy sources, such as wind, solar and hydrogen, over increased production of oil, coal and natural gas. Since 2011, the public has prioritized alternative sources over expanding production.
Last October, the gap had narrowed: 47% said the priority should be developing alternative sources while 39% said the focus should be on expanding oil, coal and natural gas. Still, while support for energy alternatives rebounded since then, it is below the 63% who favored that approach in 2011.
