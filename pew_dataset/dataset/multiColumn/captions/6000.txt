American attitudes toward China have turned sharply negative over the last two years. According to new Pew Research Center poll findings not yet released in a report, 52% of Americans have an unfavorable opinion of China, while just 37% express a favorable view. In 2011, the balance of opinion was just the opposite â€“ 51% held a favorable opinion, while just 36% gave China an unfavorable rating.
