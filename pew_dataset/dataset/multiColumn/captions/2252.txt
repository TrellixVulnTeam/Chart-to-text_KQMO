Over the past decade, opinions about levels of legal immigration into the United States have changed among members of both parties, especially among Democrats. Currently, 40% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say that legal immigration into the U.S. should be increased, 39% say it should be kept at its present level and 16% say it should be decreased.
Still, a larger share of Republicans currently support decreasing (33%) rather than increasing (22%) legal immigration into the U.S. (39% say it should be kept at its present level). Among Democrats, more than twice as many support increasing (40%) rather than decreasing (16%) legal immigration (39% of Democrats also want to keep it at its present level).
