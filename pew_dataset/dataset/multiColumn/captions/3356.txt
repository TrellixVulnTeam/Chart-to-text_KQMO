Trump receives much lower marks for both the job he has done explaining his plans and policies (39% approve) and for his cabinet choices (41% approve) than Obama received in 2009. Eight years ago, 70% approved of the job Obama had done explaining his plans and policies for the future and 66% said they approved of his cabinet selections. As reported in December, early ratings for Trump also trail those given to other recent presidents at similar points in their presidential transitions, including George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush.
