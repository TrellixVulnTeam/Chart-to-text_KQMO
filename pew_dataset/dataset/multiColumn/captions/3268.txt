With President Donald Trumpâ€™s labor secretary nominee set to appear before the Senate next week, the public has broadly positive views of both labor unions and business corporations.
About six-in-ten adults today have a favorable view of labor unions (60%) and business corporations (56%), according to a new Pew Research Center survey. Views of both have grown more positive since March 2015, when roughly half of adults (48%) expressed a favorable view of each.
