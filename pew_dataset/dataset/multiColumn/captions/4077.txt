Trouble with the law: Overall juvenile arrest rates have fallen by more than half after peaking in the mid-1990s, according to the federal Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. In 2012, nearly four of every 100 youths (ages 10 to 17) were arrested, down from about 8.5 per 100 in 1996.
However, while all racial subgroups contributed to the decline (the OJJDP doesnâ€™t report separately on Hispanics), the arrest rate for black youths is still more than twice that of any other group.
