Some Hispanics say they have changed how they outwardly show their identities over the past five years, a period that roughly starts with the launch of Trumpâ€™s presidential campaign. Before the outbreak, over a third (35%) of Hispanics said they more often outwardly express their Hispanic identity than five years ago by speaking Spanish in public (24%), talking about their pride in being Hispanic (25%) or wearing clothing that shows their Hispanic heritage (10%). Meanwhile, a similar share of Hispanics (33%) said they more often express their U.S. identity by speaking only English in public (21%), talking about their pride in being American (17%) or wearing clothing that shows their U.S. pride (11%).
Public expressions of identity differed greatly by party affiliation. About four-in-ten (44%) Hispanic Republicans said they outwardly express their U.S. pride compared with five years ago. Roughly three-in-ten (29%) of Hispanic Democrats said the same.
