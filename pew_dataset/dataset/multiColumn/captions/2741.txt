The survey also asked about perceptions of discrimination against two other groups underrepresented in the tech industry: blacks and Hispanics. (Though some have also raised concerns about how Asians are treated in the tech industry, the survey questions were limited to perceived treatment of blacks and Hispanics.)
A majority of blacks (64%) say discrimination against blacks and Hispanics is a major problem in the tech industry, and half of Hispanics agree. Only 21% of whites say this is a major problem. At the same time, 37% of whites say such discrimination isn’t a problem, compared with 11% of blacks and 12% of Hispanics.
Blacks and Hispanics are also much more likely than whites to say there is more discrimination against blacks and Hispanics in the tech industry than in other industries. Four-in-ten blacks and 35% of Hispanics say this, compared with 11% of whites.
About the survey: These are some of the findings from a survey conducted among a nationally representative sample of 4,914 adults, ages 18 and older, from July 11-Aug. 10, 2017. The survey, which was conducted online in English and in Spanish through GfK’s Knowledge Panel, included an oversample of employed adults working in science, technology, engineering and math-related fields. The margin of sampling error based on the full sample is plus or minus 2.7 percentage points. See the topline for exact question wording.
