An estimated 278,000 Hispanics of Argentine origin lived in the United States in 2017, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Argentines in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Argentine origin; this includes immigrants from Argentina and those who trace their family ancestry to Argentina.
Argentines are the 14th-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States, accounting for less than 1% of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017. Since 2000, the Argentine-origin population has increased 158%, growing from 108,000 to 278,000 over the period. At the same time, the Argentine foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew by 96%, from 83,000 in 2000 to 163,000 in 2017. By comparison, Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, constituted 36.6 million, or 62%, of the Hispanic population in 2017.
