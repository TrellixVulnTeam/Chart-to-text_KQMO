Currently, 56% say they would rather have a smaller government providing fewer services; 35% prefer a bigger government. These opinions have changed little over the course of Obamaâ€™s presidency. In October 2008, however, opinion was more evenly divided (46% smaller government vs. 40% bigger government).
