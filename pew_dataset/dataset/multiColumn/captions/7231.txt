When asked to name the single news story they followed more closely than any other last week, 42% of the public listed either reports about the economy (24%) or changes in the stock market (18%). In addition, many Americans were following news about the falling price of gas and oil – 53% followed this story very closely and 11% listed this as their most closely followed news story of the week.
With 38% of the public saying the presidential campaign was their most closely followed story last week, interest in economic news just edged out interest in the election. At the same time, the media clearly shifted its focus away from the economic crisis and back to the campaign. According to the Pew’s Project for Excellence in Journalism, 51% of the national newshole last week was devoted to the presidential campaign, while 23% of the newshole focused on the economy. Cable television news focused heavily on the campaign, with 80% of its coverage going to election news and only 12% to economic news.
