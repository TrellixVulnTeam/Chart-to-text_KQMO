To get a glimpse of how America’s racial demographics are changing, take a look at the differences between mixed-race Americans old and young. The racial background of the largest group of multiracial babies (36%) is black and white, but just 18% of mixed-race adults claim this background, according to Census Bureau data.
A similar pattern emerges for mixed-race people whose background is black and American Indian – among adults, the share is 5%, while among babies, it is just 1%. And while almost a quarter of mixed-race babies are white and Asian, this share is just 18% for adults.
