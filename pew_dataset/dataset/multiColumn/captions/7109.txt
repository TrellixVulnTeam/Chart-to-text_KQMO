The National Day of Prayer, established by Congress in 1952, occurs on May 7 this year. The U.S. Religious Landscape Survey, conducted by the Pew Research Centerâ€™s Forum on Religion & Public Life, shows that prayer is a common religious practice in America, with nearly six-in-ten adults in the U.S. saying they pray at least once a day. However, frequency of prayer differs significantly by religious tradition, age, gender and income.
