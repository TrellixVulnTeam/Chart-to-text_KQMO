A narrow majority of American parents say parents could never be too involved in a child’s education, but about four-in-ten say too much involvement could be a bad thing. Parents with family incomes of $75,000 or higher are more than twice as likely as parents with incomes below $30,000 to say that too much parental involvement in education could be a bad thing (59% vs. 23%). Parents with at least a bachelor’s degree are also more likely to say this than parents with lower levels of education.
