There are wide racial and educational differences in opinions about how the Senate should deal with the vacancy created by Scalia’s death. Fully 82% of African Americans say the Senate should hold hearings and vote on Obama’s nominee for the high court. Just half (50%) of whites agree, while 44% say the Senate should not hold hearings until the next president selects a court nominee.
By more than four to one (77% to 18%), those with postgraduate degrees say the Senate should hold hearings and vote on Obama’s nominee, rather than delaying action until the next president fills the court vacancy. Majorities of those with college degrees (60%) and some college experience (55%) also favor the Senate acting on Obama’s choice for the high court.
