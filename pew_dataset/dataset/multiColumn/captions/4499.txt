Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has found himself at the heart of the European drama surrounding the Greek debt crisis, and many around the world are voicing their opinions of Tsipras on the social media network Twitter. A new analysis of about 300,000 tweets in Greek and English, collected between July 6 and 12, finds that the conversation about the controversial leader has been primarily negative in tone, especially among those posting tweets in Greek.
Twitter offers one window into the reaction to Tsiprasâ€™ handling of the situation. Our analysis of the conversation unfolding on the social network finds some differences between English- and Greek-language tweets, but little in either language that is favorable to the prime minister.
Among Greek-language tweets studied, 75% of the conversation expressed negative sentiment about Tsipras, while 14% was positive and 11% was neutral. The Twitter activity in English was considerably larger in volume than that in Greek, and it contained a larger share of neutral discussion, but the same general pattern held. More than half (57%) of the English-language conversation about Tsipras was negative, while just 6% was positive (38% was neutral in tone).
