While worries about the war have increased, public appraisals of the war and emotional reactions to it have become less volatile. Pew’s tracking survey of more than 2,700 Americans, conducted from March 20 to April 1, shows that public perceptions of the war, which fluctuated wildly in the opening days of the war, have settled down. In recent days (March 28-April 1), about four-in-ten Americans (39%) said the war was going very well. That marked little change from the previous period (March 23-27), when 42% felt the war was going very well. As many as 65% believed this during the first few days of the war, when American forces encountered little resistance and there was widespread speculation that Saddam Hussein might have been injured or killed in the March 19 air strike on Baghdad (See “Public Confidence in War Effort Falters,” March 25, 2003).
Similarly, the latest round of polling shows that emotional reactions to the war have also stabilized. The percentage who say they have been depressed by the war grew from 30% in the first two days of the war to 40% by March 25-27; it has remained at about that level since then. Levels of reported depression are lower than during the first phase of the Persian Gulf War (50% reported being depressed by the war), and much lower than in the aftermath of Sept. 11 (71%). Other emotional responses to the war have also remained stable in recent days, including sadness, fright, and fatigue.
