Events of the last few years have taken their toll on U.S.-Canadian relations, but cross-border ties still remain stronger than U.S. ties with Europe. The image of the U.S. in Canada slipped modestly with the war in Iraq, from a 72% favorability rating before the war to 63% after the conflict, a 9 point drop. But compared with the reaction among some other American allies, this decline in support was relatively modest. U.S. favorability fell 20 points in France and 16 points in Germany over the same period. Similarly, five-in-ten Canadians (54%) still think they should maintain close security and diplomatic ties with the United States. Only two-in-ten (23%) of the French and four-in-ten (43%) of the Germans agree.
