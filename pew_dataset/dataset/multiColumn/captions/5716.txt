News interest rose across all age groups over the course of the shutdown, however, young people (under age 30) lagged well behind other age groups in following shutdown news. About a third (34%) of those ages 18-29 say they followed news about the resolution of the shutdown and debt limit increase very closely, interest was far higher among older Americans. For example, 63% of those ages 65 and older paid very close attention to the shutdown news. Over the past month, news interest has increased at least 20 points across all age groups, with gaps in interest between older and younger Americans staying relatively stable. While younger Americans typically pay less attention to news events than older Americans, the gap on the government shutdown is particularly wide.
