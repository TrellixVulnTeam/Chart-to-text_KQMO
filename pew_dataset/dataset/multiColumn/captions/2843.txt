The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts publishes its own statistics about federal jury duty, which is even rarer than state-level service because federal courts handle far fewer cases each year than state courts do. The federal statistics show a significant decline both in the number of people called to jury duty and in the number who are chosen. (The data count only petit, or trial, juries; they exclude grand juries.)
In fiscal 2016, federal courts called 194,211 people for petit jury duty, down 37% from 307,204 in fiscal 2006. And 43,697 people were selected for federal petit jury duty, down 39% from 71,578 a decade earlier. The decrease in jurors tracks a broader decline in the number of federal jury trials: In 2016, just 2% of 77,318 total federal defendants had their cases decided by a jury, half the total in 2006.
