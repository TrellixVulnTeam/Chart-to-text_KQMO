An estimated 5.6 million Hispanics of Puerto Rican origin lived in the United States in 2017, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Puerto Ricans in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Puerto Rican origin and lived in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia; this includes those who were born in Puerto Rico and those who trace their family ancestry to Puerto Rico.
Since 2000, the Puerto Rican-origin U.S. population has increased 65%, growing from 3.4 million to 5.6 million over the period. At the same time, the population of those born in Puerto Rico and living in the 50 states and D.C. grew by 27%, from 1.3 million in 2000 to 1.6 million in 2017. By comparison, Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, constituted 36.6 million, or 62%, of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017.
