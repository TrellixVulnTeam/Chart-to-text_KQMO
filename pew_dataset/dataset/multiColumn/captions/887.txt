Republicans and Democrats differ on how people across the country are reacting to the outbreak. Relatively small shares of both Republicans (30%) and Democrats (27%) say ordinary people across the country are reacting about right to the coronavirus outbreak, but partisans differ in their critique of the publicâ€™s response. Among Republicans, more say people across that country are overreacting to the outbreak than not taking it seriously enough (39% vs. 31%). The balance of opinion is the opposite among Democrats: Nearly half (48%) say people across the country are not taking the outbreak seriously enough, while fewer (25%) say they are overreacting.
