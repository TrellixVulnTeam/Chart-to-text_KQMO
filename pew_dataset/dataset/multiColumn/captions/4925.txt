These demographic changes are impacting Cuban Americans’ views of Cuba. For example, among more recent immigrant arrivals, 49% say Cuban Americans and people living in Cuba share “a lot” of values in common, according to a new analysis of a 2013 Pew Research Center survey of Hispanics. By contrast, Cuban immigrants who arrived before 1990 hold a different view: 41% say there is “only a little” or “almost nothing” in common between Cuban Americans and people living in Cuba. (The sample size of those born in the U.S. is too small to provide reliable estimates.)
