Support for the United Nations was highest in Indonesia, where the UN played a key role in relief efforts in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami that devastated parts of that country in December 2004. Nearly eight-in-ten Indonesians (78%) said they held a favorable view of the United Nations while 18% said their view of the organization was unfavorable.
In the other Muslim countries surveyed, however, reviews of the UN were significantly less upbeat. Barely 30% of those interviewed in Jordan held a favorable view while 69% had an unfavorable impression, the highest level of disapproval in any of the 15 countries. Only 29% of Turks had a positive opinion, with just over half (51%) giving the UN negative marks. In Egypt, public opinion was divided: 49% had a favorable view but 51% had an unfavorable view. Slightly more than four-in-ten Pakistanis (42%) had a positive opinion, while 22% disapproved and 36% did not offer an opinion, easily the largest proportion of no opinion responses recorded in any of the surveys.
In neighboring India, a relatively large number of respondents (26%) also expressed no opinion about the United Nations; those expressing a view split nearly evenly, 39% favorable, 35% unfavorable. Elsewhere in Asia, views were more mixed. A 56%-majority held a favorable opinion in Japan, a view shared by a 53%-majority in China.
The publics of key U.S. allies in Western Europe were broadly favorable toward the UN, the surveys revealed. Large majorities in France (72%), Germany (68%), Great Britain (65%) and Spain (60%) said they had a positive view of the organization.
