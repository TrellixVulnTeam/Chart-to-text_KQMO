Looking at other political values of GOP voters, Republicans who say the best way to ensure peace is through military strength offer somewhat more positive ratings of Trump than do those who think diplomacy is the best way to ensure peace (58% warm vs. 47% warm).
There is little relationship between Republicansâ€™ views of some social issues and ratings of Trump. Those who say homosexuality should be discouraged by society and those who say it should be accepted are about equally warm toward the presumptive GOP nominee. And views about whether society is better off if people prioritize marriage and children similarly show no relationship to views of Trump.
