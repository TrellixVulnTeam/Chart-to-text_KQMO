In late 2002, in the run-up to U.S. military conflict, it was older adults who were the most dovish about military action in Iraq. While adults under 30 favored military action by three-to-one (69% favor-23% oppose), adults 65 and older offered less support (51%-31%). And during the past decade of Pew Research polling, adults 65 and older consistently have been the least likely to say the U.S. made the right decision in using military force in Iraq.
