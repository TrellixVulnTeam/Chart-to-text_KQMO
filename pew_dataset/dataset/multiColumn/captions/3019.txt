The JOLTS program doesn’t produce state-level data, but it does indicate that the South had the most job openings in April of any region – nearly 2.2 million – though the openings rate there (3.9%) was slightly below that of the nation as a whole. The Midwest had the nation’s highest regional openings rate (4.4%), followed by the Northeast (4.1%); the rate in the West lagged behind at 3.6%.
Nationally, workers appear to be in shortest supply in two service sectors: professional/business services and healthcare/social assistance. Both had well over 1 million job openings in April – roughly one-third more than the sector with the third-highest number, accommodation and food services. All three of those sectors had openings rates of 5% or higher, as did the catchall “other services” sector.
