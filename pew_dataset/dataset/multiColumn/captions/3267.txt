From 1950 to 2000, women’s labor force participation had increased rapidly (particularly among married women and married mothers), while men’s participation declined. For example, during the 1960s the female labor force grew, on average, three times faster than the male labor force – 3.1% per year versus 1.0% per year. By 2000, 59.9% of women were in the labor force, up from 37.7% in 1960. This rapid growth boosted women’s representation in the work force overall.
The steady growth in women’s labor force representation slowed in the 1990s as women’s participation peaked. Labor force participation declined for both men and women between 2000 and 2015, so the growth rates of the male and female labor force are now quite similar on average: 0.8% per year for women between 2000 and 2010, compared with 0.7% for men. (The labor force can grow in spite of falling labor force participation because the working-age population is increasing.)
Looking forward, the BLS projections assume labor force participation will continue to decline for both men and women at similar rates. The result is that both labor forces are expected to grow by 0.5% or less per year.
