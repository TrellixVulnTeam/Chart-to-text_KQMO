Part of the reason behind the absence of data on this group is the size of the multiracial population – it’s still relatively small. As you note, we estimate that only about 6.9% of the adult population has a mixed-race background. And by the Census Bureau’s definition the share is just 2.1%. That means even large, nationally representative surveys typically include too few mixed-race adults to analyze, much less contain sufficiently sized samples of individual multiracial groups such as white and black or white and Asian biracial adults.
