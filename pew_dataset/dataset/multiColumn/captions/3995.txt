The NATO alliance commits each member to come to the collective defense of a member if it is attacked. During the confrontation with Russia over Ukraine last year, a majority of Americans (56%) were willing to fulfill this security commitment if Russia got into a serious military conflict with a NATO ally. But that finding masked a partisan divide: Nearly seven-in-ten Republicans (69%), but only 47% of Democrats, supported using force to aid a NATO ally attacked by Russia.
Last yearâ€™s survey found that the U.S. and Canada were the only countries in which more than half of respondents backed using military force if Russia got into a serious conflict with a NATO ally. At least half of Germans, French and Italians said their countries should not use military force to defend a NATO ally if attacked by Russia. When it came specifically to aiding Ukraine, half or fewer in every NATO country surveyed supported the idea of the alliance sending arms to the Ukrainians.
