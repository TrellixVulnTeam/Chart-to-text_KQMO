These findings are based on the most recent installment of the weekly News Interest Index, an ongoing project of the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The index, building on the Center’s longstanding research into public attentiveness to major news stories, examines news interest as it relates to the news media’s agenda. The weekly survey is conducted in conjunction with The Project for Excellence in Journalism’s News Coverage Index, which monitors the news reported by major newspaper, television, radio and online news outlets on an ongoing basis. In the most recent week, data relating to news coverage was collected from April 7-13 and survey data measuring public interest in the top news stories of the week was collected April 11-14 from a nationally representative sample of 1,003 adults.
The Iraq policy debate was back in the news last week, as Gen. David Petraeus delivered his latest progress report on the war to members of Congress. The national news media devoted 10% of its coverage to the Iraq policy debate and another 4% to events on the ground in Iraq. Roughly one-in-five Americans (19%) paid very close attention to Petraeus’ appearance before Congress. Just 6% listed news about Petraeus as the single story they followed more closely than any other last week – ranking it fifth among the top six stories of the week.
