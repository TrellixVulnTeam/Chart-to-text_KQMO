While Democrats are far more supportive than Republicans of legalizing the use of marijuana, they have similar views of a hypothetical presidential candidate who used marijuana in the past. Large majorities of Democrats (78%) and Republicans (74%) say a candidateâ€™s past use of marijuana would not matter.
Democrats and Republicans also have about the same views of a candidate who has had personal financial troubles. Roughly four-in-ten in both parties (42%) say they would be less likely to support such a candidate, while 50% of Republicans and 48% of Democrats say this would not matter.
