The majority of Baby Boomers (U.S. adults born 1946 to 1964) are still in the labor force, and the oldest among them are staying in the labor force at the highest annual rate for people their age in more than half a century. In 2018, 29% of Boomers ages 65 to 72 were working or looking for work, outpacing the labor market engagement of the Silent Generation (21%) and the Greatest Generation (19%) when they were the same age, according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of official labor force data.
Between 2011 (when the oldest Baby Boomer reached age 65) and 2029 (when the youngest Boomer turns age 65), roughly 3.8 million Boomers are expected to turn 65 each year, or about 10,000 daily. However, in part because of older Boomersâ€™ robust participation rates, 10,000 Boomers are not exiting the labor force every day. Rather, the Boomer labor force has been declining by 2.2 million on average each year since 2010, or about 5,900 daily.
