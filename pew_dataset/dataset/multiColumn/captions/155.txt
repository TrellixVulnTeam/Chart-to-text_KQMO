The U.S. is the leading defense spender among member states, committing an estimated 3.87% of GDP to defense expenditures in 2020. Nine other countries – including several in Central and Eastern Europe – also meet NATO’s 2% threshold. Just one country – Luxembourg – spends less than 1% of GDP on defense.
While Trump has been openly critical of the level of allies’ defense spending, estimated defense expenditures as a share of GDP have risen since 2016, not only in the U.S. but among key NATO allies as well. For example, this year marks the first in which France is estimated to spend over 2% of GDP on defense. The UK has already reached this threshold, and German defense spending is on the rise.
