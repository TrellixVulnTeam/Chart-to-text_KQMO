Among all registered voters, Hillary Clinton registers the greatest share of support. One-third (33%) of voters say there is a good chance they would vote for her, while an additional 19% say there is at least some chance. No more than 13% say there is a good chance they would vote for any single other candidate.
However, among the field of possible candidates beyond Clinton, there is little differentiation at this early stage. This is particularly the case when it comes to possible GOP contenders: Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker and Ben Carson all have about one-in-ten registered voters saying there is a good chance they would vote for them.
At this stage, there is considerable variance in awareness of potential candidates. Virtually all voters have heard of Clinton, and Biden and Jeb Bush also are widely known. Among the other Republicans, Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Rick Perry, and Marco Rubio are familiar to at least two-thirds of voters. But fewer than half of all voters have heard of Bobby Jindal, Ben Carson or Scott Walker. Among the other Democrats, just over half of voters have heard of Elizabeth Warren and less than a third say they are familiar with either Jim Webb or Martin Oâ€™Malley.
