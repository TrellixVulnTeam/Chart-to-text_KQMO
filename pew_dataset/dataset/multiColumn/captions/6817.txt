Latinos continue to lag behind non-Latinos in cell phone use. Just over three-fourths (76%) of Latinos ages 18 and older use cell phones; this number is 86% among non-Latinos.9 The same is true with regard to internet use, despite marked gains by Latinos in recent years (Livingston, Parker and Fox 2009). Some 64% of Latinos use the internet, compared with 78% of non-Latinosâ€”a 14 percentage point difference.
