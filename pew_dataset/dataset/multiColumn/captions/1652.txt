Six-in-ten or more Indonesians say they are likely to take political action on a range of issues, but most say they have never actually participated in civic activities. About two-thirds (66%) said they would take action such as contacting an election official or participating in demonstrations when it comes to poor quality schools or health care. Roughly as many (65%) said they would do so if the issue was poverty, and 62% said they would engage in political activity in support of freedom of speech.
