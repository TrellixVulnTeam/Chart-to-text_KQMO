To determine the specific kinds of occupations with the most growth potential, we combined the job preparation and skill ratings the Center developed for its report with the projections from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook Handbook. Ratings and projections were available for 541 separate occupations, in 24 different sectors spanning the U.S. civilian workforce. All together, they cover nearly 149 million jobs, or virtually the entire workforce. (More than 7 million Americans, according to the BLS, work more than one job.)
If we consider the BLS’s full set of employment projections (which includes 30 or so “catchall” occupations covering an additional 1.5 million jobs), the strongest growth is foreseen for operations research analysts, statisticians, actuaries and other mathematics-oriented jobs: Employment in math occupations is expected to grow by 28%, though that’s off a fairly small base (the group had only 152,400 jobs in 2014). Health care (18.6%), personal care and service (13.1%) and computer and information technology (12.5%) were the other employment sectors with particularly fast projected growth. On the other hand, employment in production occupations is expected to fall by 3.1% by 2024 (representing more than 282,000 jobs), and employment in farming, fishing and forestry occupations is projected to shrink by 5.9%.
