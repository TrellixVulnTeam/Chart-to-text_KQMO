Most U.S adult Twitter users don’t tweet very often. A large majority of tweets come from a small minority of users. The median Twitter user produces two tweets per month, according to a 2019 study. However, among the most prolific tweeters – defined as those in the top 10% in the number of tweets they send – the median user produces 138 tweets each month. And that group of highly prolific tweeters dominates discourse on the platform more broadly: 80% of all tweets from American adults come from the top 10% of tweeters.
