Nearly two-thirds (65%) of Mexicans surveyed after the law’s enactment had heard about it, and the image of the U.S. in Mexico took a nosedive, according to a 2010 Pew Research Center survey. Prior to enactment of the law, 62% of Mexicans had a favorable view of their northern neighbor while only 27% held a negative one. After the measure became law, 48% of Mexicans registered a negative view of the U.S. while 44% expressed a positive one. The survey did not specifically ask if the law was the reason for the change in opinions.
But positive views of the U.S. have bounced back since then. In a survey this spring, 66% of Mexicans said they viewed the U.S. favorably compared to 30% who did not. That represented a gain of 22 percentage points among Mexicans surveyed after the law’s passage in2010.
