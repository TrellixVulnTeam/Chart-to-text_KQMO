Pew Research Center also asked about how minorities are depicted in video games. Roughly half (47%) of American adults say they are unsure of whether video games portray minority groups poorly. Interestingly, this is the most common response regardless of race or ethnicity.
Blacks (13%) are more likely than whites (7%) to say most video games portray minority groups poorly. Still, close to half of all blacks (47%) say they are uncertain if video games depict minorities in a bad light.
