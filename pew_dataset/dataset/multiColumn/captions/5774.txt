As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares to visit President Obama at the White House on Monday, Americans and Israelis continue to hold each other in high regard. A spring 2013 Pew Research Center survey found that an overwhelming majority of Israelis (83%) have a favorable opinion of the U.S. This represents an 11 percentage point increase since 2011. At the same time, 57% of Americans view Israel positively.
