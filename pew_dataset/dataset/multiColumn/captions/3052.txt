Americans who are more politically engaged are more likely to donate. During the 2016 campaign, politically engaged Americans were much more likely to make political donations. Those who said they follow what is going on in government and public affairs most of the time reported donating at a rate of 28%, compared with less than 7% of those who follow government and public affairs some of the time or less often, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Sept. 27-Oct. 10, 2016. Among those who say they vote always or nearly always, 21% said that they made a donation, compared with 4% of those who seldom voted or voted only part of the time.
Democrats were twice as likely as Republicans to say they donated last year. In 2016, 22% of Democrats and Democratic leaners and 10% Republicans and Republican leaners reported making a donation, according to data from ANES. This marks the first election since at least 1992 when Democrats have been significantly more likely than Republicans to donate.
