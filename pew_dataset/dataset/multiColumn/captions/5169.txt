How has the internet changed society? And what will its impact be in the future? Our research on the evolution of digital life for 15 years has tracked skyrocketing adoption rates for broadband, mobile and social media, and studied how the internet has changed our political engagement, civic discussion, dating and social ties, as well as how we manage our health. Technology has transformed our lives around digital networks, as chronicled in research director Lee Rainie’s book, “Networked,” co-authored with professor Barry Wellman in 2012. The project has also paid special attention to the online life of key groups ranging from teens to senior citizens and it has done research informing key policy debates, such as those swirling around privacy.
