Americans have complicated views about the role social media companies should play in removing offensive content from their platforms.
A sizable majority of U.S. adults (66%) say social media companies have a responsibility to remove offensive content from their platforms, but just 31% have a great deal or fair amount of confidence in these companies to determine what offensive content should be removed.
Overall, about half of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (52%) say social media companies have a responsibility to remove offensive content from their platforms. A much larger share of Democrats and Democratic leaners (77%) say social media companies have this responsibility.
