Only 13% of Americans, however, have a great deal of confidence that space companies will sufficiently address the debris problem, while 51% have not too much or no confidence, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. Yet, the same survey finds that, among the 7% of the public that is highly attentive to space news – those who say they have heard “a lot” about NASA in the past year and “a lot” about private space companies – some 37% have a great deal of confidence that private companies will minimize space debris.
