Support for government funding for alternative energy research has fallen since 2009, but this policy continues to draw more support than other ways to address America’s supply. Nearly six-in-ten (58%) favor more oil and gas drilling in U.S. waters and the same percentage favors allowing more mining and drilling on federally owned land.
Support for increased offshore drilling is little changed from March, but has increased since last year’s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. In June 2o1o, before the spill was contained, only 44% favored more offshore drilling. Slightly fewer Americans favor increased offshore drilling today than did so a few months before the Gulf spill (63% in February 2010).
More Americans continue to oppose (53%) than favor (39%) promoting the increased use of nuclear power. Support for increased use of nuclear power has not recovered following the nuclear disaster at Japan’s Fukushima nuclear power plant. Opinion about increased nuclear power had been divided prior to the Japan disaster. (For more, see “Opposition to Nuclear Power Rises Amid Japanese Crisis,” March 21, 2011).
