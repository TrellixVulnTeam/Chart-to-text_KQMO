The EPA encourages people to “reduce, reuse and recycle,” noting that doing so “helps conserve energy and reduces pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from resource extraction, manufacturing, and disposal.” But the agency’s own data indicates that the overall recovery rate (from recycling, composting and other processes) has nearly plateaued, following strong growth in the 1980s and 1990s and slower but steady growth through the 2000s. In 2012, about 34.5% of all municipal solid waste generated was recycled, composted or otherwise recovered.
Nearly two-thirds of paper and paperboard, the single biggest category of municipal solid waste, was recovered in 2012, as was nearly 58% of yard trimmings, the third-biggest category. But less than 5% of food waste – the second-biggest category, with more than 36 million tons generated annually – was composted or otherwise recovered. And only 8.8% of plastic waste, nearly 32 million tons of which was generated in 2012, was recycled or otherwise recovered.
