The recent attacks in Paris, France and San Bernardino, Calif. have not led to a fundamental shift in how the public views the U.S. military campaign against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria.
About six-in-ten (58%) say the U.S. effort against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria is going either not too well (39%) or not at all well (19%); 35% say the campaign is going either very (7%) or fairly (28%) well. Views have changed little on this question over the course of the past year, with majorities consistently offering negative assessments of the current state of the campaign.
