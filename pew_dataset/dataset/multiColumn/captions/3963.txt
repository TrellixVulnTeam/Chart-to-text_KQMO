India lags behind other emerging nations in internet access and smartphone ownership. Across the 21 emerging and developing nations surveyed in 2015 (including India), a median of 54% have internet access and 37% own smartphones. In India, however, only 22% have internet access and only 17% have a smartphone.
Like most of the 40 countries surveyed in 2015, there are big demographic differences in internet access. Younger, more-educated and higher-income Indians are more likely to use the web than older, less-educated and lower-income Indians (relative to the median household income within India). Men are also more likely to have access than women, as are Indians residing in the wealthier North and West regions of India where major cities like Delhi and Mumbai are located compared with the less prosperous South and East. Overall, these patterns hold true among Indiaâ€™s smartphone users as well.
