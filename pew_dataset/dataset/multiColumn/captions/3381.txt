As we found during the campaign, Republicans and Democrats are more likely to discuss the election with people on their side than with those on the other side. Eight-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners say they’ve had a conversation with someone who supported Trump, and about seven-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners (72%) say they’ve had a conversation with someone who supported Hillary Clinton. By contrast, fewer Republicans (45%) and Democrats (40%) say they’ve had a conversation with a supporter of the other candidate.
