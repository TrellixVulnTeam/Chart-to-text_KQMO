In recent years, the debate over illegal immigration has often been posed as a choice between two competing prioritiesâ€”increasing border security and enforcement or providing a path to citizenship to immigrants who are in the country illegally.
Latinos are nearly twice as likely as the general public (42% versus 24%) to say the priority should be a path to citizenship for immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally.
About as many Latinos as the general public (46% versus 43%) say equal priority should be given to enforcement and legalization. Just 10% of Latinos say priority should be given to better border security and enforcement, compared with 29% of the general public.
