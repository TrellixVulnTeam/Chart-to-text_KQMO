When it comes to views of how accepting society in general is of people who don’t identify as either a man or a woman, a plurality of Americans (41%) say society is not accepting enough, while roughly a third (32%) say it is too accepting and a quarter say it is about right. Views diverge sharply by partisanship and age here too, with Democrats and younger adults more likely than Republicans and those who are older to say society is not accepting enough of people who don’t identify as a man or a woman.
