An estimated 243,000 Hispanics of Argentinean origin resided in the United States in 2013, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.
Argentineans are the 14th-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States, accounting for 0.5% of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2013. Since 1990, the Argentinean-origin population has more than doubled, growing from 103,000 to 243,000 over the period. At the same time, the Argentinean foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew by 85%, up from 81,000 in 1990 to 149,000 in 2013. By comparison, Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, constituted 34.6 million, or 64.1%, of the Hispanic population in 2013.
