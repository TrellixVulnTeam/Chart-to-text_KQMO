In the 2016 election, a wide gap in presidential preferences emerged between those with and without a college degree, our post-election analysis of national exit poll data found. College graduates backed Clinton by a 9-point margin (52%-43%), while those without a college degree backed Trump 52%-44%. This was by far the widest gap in support among college graduates and non-college graduates in exit polls dating back to 1980.
