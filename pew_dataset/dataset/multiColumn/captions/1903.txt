As more Americans are going cash-free, a growing share of the public is comfortable being without physical currency. Today, 53% of Americans say they try to make sure they always have cash on hand just in case they need it. That represents a 7-percentage-point decline from the 60% who reported this in 2015. Conversely, just under half (46%) of Americans “don’t really worry much about whether they have cash with them, since there are lots of other ways to pay for things.” That is an increase from 2015, when 39% reported this. Roughly four-in-ten who say they do not really worry about carrying cash (43%) say they don’t use cash for their typical weekly purchases, compared with 18% of Americans who report that they try to ensure that they always have cash.
