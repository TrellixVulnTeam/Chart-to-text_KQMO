Outside of the campaign, the economy and Iraq, Americans showed little interest in last weekâ€™s other news stories. Just 5% followed news about the upcoming summer Olympics in Beijing very closely and even fewer (2%) called it their most closely followed story of the week. Interest was somewhat higher in news about a government proposal to overhaul national financial regulations; 17% of the public followed the story very closely, while 3% called it their top story.
