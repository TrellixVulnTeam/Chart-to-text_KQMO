While the media focused squarely on the federal budget and broader debate in Washington on how to address the deficit and national debt, the public expressed greater interest in the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and news about rising fuel prices.
About a quarter (26%) say they followed news about the tragedy in Japan most closely, making this the publicâ€™s top story last week. Japan shared the top spot one week earlier with news about the threat of a government shutdown over budget disagreements.
This past week, rising domestic gas and oil prices also captured more attention than the federal spending debate in Washington. Nearly a quarter (22%) followed fuel prices most closely and a majority (53%) reported following this news very closely. The media devoted just 1% of all coverage to this issue.
