Overall, more Americans perceive fact-checkers as fair than say the same of news organizations more generally – but news organizations, too, elicit sharply divergent views from members of the two parties. Roughly seven-in-ten Americans (72%) say news organizations tend to favor one side when covering political and social issues – notably higher than the half who say the same about fact-checkers. Republicans are 32 points more likely than Democrats to have this view, though majorities of both parties say this (89% of Republicans vs. 57% of Democrats), and again, independents fall in between (72%). The partisan difference on this question is on par with the prior two years it has been asked, and is larger than at any time in the previous three decades except in 2007, at the end of President George W. Bush’s second term in office.
