In the UK, people who have favorable views of the Labour Party (42%) or Liberal Democrats (40%) are more likely to say that the UK has declined in importance than those who have positive views of the Conservatives (27%) or far-right UKIP (25%). This sense of decline has increased among Labour supporters since 2016, prior to the Brexit vote. In contrast, those who have a favorable opinion of UKIP – the group which largely helped to spearhead the Brexit vote – are much less likely to see the country in decline now than they were in 2016 (25%, down from 46%).
