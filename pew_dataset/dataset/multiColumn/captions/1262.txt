Many Europeans are dissatisfied with the way democracy is working, but there is considerable variation by country. Those living in Sweden are the most positive about the state of democracy in their country (72% satisfied). Majorities in the Netherlands, Poland, Germany, Lithuania and the Czech Republic are also satisfied.
On the other hand, roughly two-thirds or more in Greece, Bulgaria, the UK, Italy and Spain are not satisfied with the state of democracy in their country. Russians and Ukrainians are also less than happy with how democracy is working in their respective countries.
