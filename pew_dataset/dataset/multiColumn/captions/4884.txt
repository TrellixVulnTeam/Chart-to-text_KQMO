Strengthening the economy has been among the publicâ€™s leading policy goals since the Pew Research Center began asking the question in 2000. The share citing the economy as a top priority increased during the recession, before declining over the past two years.
The decline in the importance of improving the job situation has been particularly striking among those with higher incomes. In 2013, 78% of those with family incomes of $75,000 or more said that improving the job situation was a top priority for the president and Congress. Nearly identical shares of those with lower incomes also viewed this as a top goal: 76% of those with family incomes of $30,000-$75,000 and 79% among household earning less than $30,000. Since then, jobs have fallen 21 points as a top priority among those with incomes of at least $75,000 (57%), and 9 points among those with incomes of $30,000 to $75,000 (67%).
