In a Pew Research Center survey conducted the last week of April, 18% said they had followed the chemical-weapons story “very closely,” up from 13% who said they were following the Syrian conflict very closely a month earlier. A quarter of respondents in the latest survey said they were following the story “fairly closely,” compared with 22% a month previous.
