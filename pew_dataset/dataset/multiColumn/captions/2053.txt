Views of why some people are rich and poor also vary by family income. Those with annual family incomes of $75,000 or more are more likely than those with incomes of less than $30,000 (49% vs. 36%) to say being wealthy is more attributable to hard work than to a personâ€™s advantages. Those with lower incomes, in turn, are more likely than those with higher incomes to say a person is poor more because of circumstances beyond their control than because of a lack of effort.
