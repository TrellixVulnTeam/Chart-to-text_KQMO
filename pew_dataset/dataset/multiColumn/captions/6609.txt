With the employment picture slowly improving in recent months, fewer Americans say they are hearing mostly bad news about the job situation. At the same time, perceptions of news about prices – especially gas prices – remain overwhelmingly negative.
Currently, 43% say they are hearing mostly bad news about the job situation – down seven points from last month and the lowest percentage since June 2009, when the question was first asked. About as many (42%) say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news, while 12% say they are hearing mostly good news about jobs.
However, perceptions of news about prices – gas prices as well as prices for food and consumer goods – have gotten worse since February. Currently, 88% say they are hearing mostly bad news about gas prices and 59% say the same about prices of food and consumer goods.
