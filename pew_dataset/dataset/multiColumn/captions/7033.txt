After the debate over health care reform, news about swine flu and the economy vied for public attention, with other stories registering less widely.
Fully 45% say they followed reports about the condition of the U.S. economy very closely; 15% name it as their most closely followed story of the week.
According to a separate analysis of coverage by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism, the health care debate took up about a third (32%) of the week’s newshole. Coverage of the economy was relatively modest, filling 9% of the newshole.
Reports about swine flu and the availability of a vaccine were followed very closely by a somewhat smaller percentage of the public (30%). However, just as many call swine flu their top story of the week (16%) as cited the economy (15%). In general, swine flu interest outpaced coverage: just 2% of the newshole was devoted to the story last week.
