The pattern plays out in reverse when it comes to the perceived susceptibility of scientists to bias. Roughly two-thirds of Republicans with high science knowledge (64%) say scientists are just as likely to be biased as other people, compared with 42% of those with low science knowledge. In contrast, Democrats with low, medium and high science knowledge are all about equally likely to think scientists are susceptible to bias (34% to 39%).
