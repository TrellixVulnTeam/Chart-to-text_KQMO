While we don’t have much demographic information about the quiz-takers, we do know that they were much more likely than the general population to live in large cities or nearby suburbs, and less likely to live in a small city or town—and were half as likely as the national population to live in a rural area. This lines up with our previous research, which found that people who live in rural areas are more likely to be older and living in lower-income households, and likewise less likely to use libraries.
