Among individual cable news outlets, CNNâ€™s regular audience has declined since 2008. Four years ago, nearly a quarter of Americans (24%) said they regularly watched CNN; that has fallen to 16% in the new survey.
Regular viewership for both Fox News and MSNBC has not changed much in recent years. About one-in-five Americans (21%) say they regularly watch Fox News, while about half as many (11%) say they regularly watch MSNBC.
