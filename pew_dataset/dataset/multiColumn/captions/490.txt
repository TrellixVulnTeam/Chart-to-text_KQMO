Two-thirds of Republican attenders say their house of worship is open to the public with changes as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, while 43% of Democrats say this. Democratic congregants are more likely than Republicans to say that their houses of worship are closed altogether (42% vs. 23%). And small shares in both parties say that their houses of worship are currently open to the public and operating in the same way that they did before the outbreak (7% of Republicans say this, as do 5% of Democrats).
