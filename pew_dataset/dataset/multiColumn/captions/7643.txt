Internet users in their twenties are more likely than those in their fifties and sixties to have traveled far and wide online, trying new things and possibly learning hard lessons about the dangers that lurk on the network. In a survey focused on the impact of software intrusions on the internet, the Pew Internet Project found that younger internet users are more likely than older users to say they have spyware on their home computers (45% of internet users ages 18-28 report having spyware, compared to 27% of internet users ages 51-59). With the exception of reading user agreements more carefully, internet users between 18 and 28 years old are also more likely than those in their fifties to make changes in their online behavior to avoid getting unwanted software programs on their computer.
