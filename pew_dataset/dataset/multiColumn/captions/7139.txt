The latest Pew Research Center News IQ survey finds the American public reasonably well-informed about a number of basic facts pertaining to the current economic situation. Fully 83% know that the government assistance to banks and other financial institutions is aimed at getting them to lend more money, not less money. Roughly seven-in-ten (71%) correctly identify China as the foreign country holding the most U.S. government debt.
A majority of Americans (58%) know that Timothy Geithner serves as the treasury secretary. And 51% are aware that of the three major U.S. automakers, Ford is the one that has not received emergency loans from the government.
Notably, more Americans know the current unemployment rate than the current level of the Dow Jones Industrial Average: 53% correctly estimated the unemployment rate at about 8% (the rate was 8.1% in February, but is projected to rise to 8.5% in March). That compares with 40% who correctly estimated the level of the Dow average at about 8,000; it ranged from 7,696 to 7,925 during the survey field period. This is slightly lower than awareness of the Dow average in the Pew Research Centerâ€™s December 2008 News IQ survey, when 45% got this question right.
Beyond the economy, the survey also addressed public awareness of some basic facts about U.S policy toward Afghanistan. Two-thirds (66%) are aware that Barack Obama has decided to increase the number of U.S. troops stationed in Afghanistan (21% believe he decided to decrease troop levels and 7% said he decided to make no changes). Roughly the same proportion (69%) responded correctly that Pakistan and Afghanistan share a border; 15% say the two countries do not share a border and 16% offered no response.
