Roughly four-in-ten Americans (37%) say they have ever used Instagram online or on their cellphone, according to a survey conducted in January and February of 2019. The share of U.S. adults who say they have ever used the site has grown from 9% in 2012, when the Center first began asking about the platform. At the time of the survey, though Instagram had grown to be one of the more popular online platforms in the United States, most Americans still did not use it, unlike the two most popular social media platforms – YouTube and Facebook – which were used by majorities of U.S. adults (73% and 69%, respectively).
