While public views of the situation in Iraq have grown more negative, there has been no change in opinions about whether U.S. forces should be withdrawn from the country. The public remains evenly divided between those who favor keeping “military troops in Iraq until the situation has stabilized” (47%), and those who think “the U.S. should bring its troops home as soon as possible” (47%).
Since June, the share of the public saying we should keep troops in Iraq has hovered between 47% and 50%, while during the same time period the percentage who believe the war is going well first dropped from 53% to 41%, then rose to 47%, and has now declined once more to 37%.
