Algorithm-driven social media platforms can produce feelings of anger in their users – and most Americans are skeptical that the content they see on social media reflects reality. Nearly all the content an individual user might see on social media is chosen by computer programs attempting to deliver content that they might find relevant or engaging. When asked about emotions they experience from the content they see on social media, the largest share of users (44%) say they frequently feel amused – but 25% say they frequently feel angry as a result of what they see on social media. More broadly, a majority of Americans (74%) think the content people post on social media does not provide an accurate picture of how society feels about important issues.
