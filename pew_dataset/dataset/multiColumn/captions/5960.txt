In many cases, the political divides over these issues are wider than the racial or ethnic differences. And as with many other issues, the debate over affirmative action is becoming more polarized along partisan lines, largely due to increased support for such programs by Democrats. When Pew Research first began asking the”preferential treatment” question back in 1987, only 33% of Democrats supported the principle; by 2012 that figure had risen to 52%.
Meanwhile, Republicans have remained solid in their disapproval: Just 12% agree that we should make every possible effort, including preferential treatment, to improve the position of blacks and other minorities – virtually unchanged from 15% a quarter-century ago.
