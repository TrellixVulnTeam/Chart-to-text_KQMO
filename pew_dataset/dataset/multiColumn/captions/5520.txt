Two years ago, according to Vital Statistics, 38 representatives either retired or ran for some other office instead of their House seat. Since 1930, the year with the highest House turnover was 1992, the year the House banking and post office scandals broke. 65 representatives retired or ran for something else that year; while that might have counted as an “exodus,” this year’s departures do not.
