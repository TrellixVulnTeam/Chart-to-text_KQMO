When it came to specifics, the public was far less interested in their side compromising. For example, when people were asked if they wanted their preferred party to compromise on abortion policy or stick to its position, just one-quarter (25%) chose compromise and 72% preferred not compromising, even at the risk of getting nothing done. And on other political issues, where specific choices were mentioned, only about half said that their side should compromise to reach an agreement. Among those who said that a certain issue was their top priority, even fewer said their side should compromise on it.
