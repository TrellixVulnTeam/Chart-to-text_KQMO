Increased cooperation with other countries is generally supported in both nations. In a Körber-Stiftung-sponsored survey fielded in Germany just before federal elections, people were asked whether Germany should cooperate more or less with various powers also included in Pew Research Center’s survey. Majorities said their country should cooperate more with each of these powers, but there were large variations in the strength of the responses. For example, nine-in-ten in Germany said the country should cooperate more with France. But only 56% of Germans wanted to cooperate more with the U.S., while about a third would cooperate less (34%).
When the Center asked the same question of Americans in October, majorities in the U.S. also said their country should cooperate more with Great Britain, France, Germany and China. But only 43% of people in the U.S. say their country should cooperate more with Russia, while 44% would cooperate less with the Kremlin. This is in stark contrast to opinion in Germany, where 78% want to cooperate more with Moscow.
