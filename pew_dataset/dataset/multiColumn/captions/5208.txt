This increasingly positive attitude toward national conditions can also be seen in the publicâ€™s improving economic assessments, as the country recovers from the global recession that began in 2008. Thirty-seven percent say the current economic situation is good, up 20 percentage points from last spring. Though 51% still believe the economy is in poor shape, this number has dropped 30 percentage points in only a year. Again, men (45%) are more likely than women (28%) to say that the economy is doing well.
