America’s edge over Russia in terms of global popularity has shrunk. While Russia was still viewed far less favorably than either the U.S. or China last year, a sharp decline in America’s favorability improved Russia’s standing relative to the U.S. Overall, a median of 50% across the 33 nations surveyed had a positive image of the U.S. in 2017 versus 35% who viewed Russia favorably. In previous years, 64% across these same nations had a favorable view of the U.S. compared with a median of 28% favorability for Russia.
