Hindus are among the least educated of the world’s major religious groups when looked at globally, but this is not true of Hindus everywhere, especially those who are living in economically advanced nations, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of religion and education.
Nearly all (98%) of the world’s Hindu adults live in these three countries, which explains why patterns among Hindus in South Asia align very closely with patterns among Hindus overall. Worldwide, Hindu adults average 5.6 years of education, compared to a global average of 7.7 years for all adults. Hindus rank significantly behind Jews, Christians, religiously unaffiliated people and Buddhists.
