This pattern also is seen in views of the partiesâ€™ efforts in addressing concerns of several other groups: Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say their party does too little to address the concerns of blacks (50% of Democrats vs. 32% of Republicans), Hispanics (43% vs. 29%) and men (26% vs. 16%). And while 64% of Democrats say their party does too little to address the concerns of people in rural areas, a smaller share of Republicans (45%) say this about the GOP.
