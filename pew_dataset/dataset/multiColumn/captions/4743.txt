The new survey finds little change in the public’s sympathies in the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians, or in views of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. About a third of Americans (31%) say they sympathize with Israel a lot in its dispute with the Palestinians, while 34% say they sympathize with Israel some. Just 11% sympathize a great deal with the Palestinians, and 35% have some sympathy for the Palestinians. These views have not changed much since last August.
