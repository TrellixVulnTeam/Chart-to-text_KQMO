The gap between partisan leaning and support for Obama is particularly clear among older white voters. As is the case with younger voters overall, the share of younger white voters who affiliate with the Democratic Party and the share that supports Barack Obama is almost identical. However, among white voters ages 50 and older, substantially fewer support Obama than identify with or lean to the Democratic Party. There was no such gap in 2004, when the balance of party and the balance of support for John Kerry was virtually identical across all age groups.
