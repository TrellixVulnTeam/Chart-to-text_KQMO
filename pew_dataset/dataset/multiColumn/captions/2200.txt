Since Trump’s inauguration in January 2017, Democrats’ views of both the Department of Justice and the Environmental Protection Agency have become far less positive. For both agencies, Democrats’ favorability ratings are near their lowest levels in the past eight years.
Today, 57% of Democrats and Democratic leaners view the Justice Department favorably, while 36% have an unfavorable opinion. The share of Democrats with favorable views of the department have fallen 17 percentage points since January of last year (from 74% to 57%).
Republicans’ views of the Justice Department have become more favorable since then; 60% view the department favorably, up from 47% about a year and a half ago.
