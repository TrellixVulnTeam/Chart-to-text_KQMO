The Brazilian public expects a recovery soon. While recent economic forecasts point to a slow recovery, the majority of the Brazilian public remains confident that the economy will bounce back in the near future. Nearly seven-in-ten Brazilians (69%) say the countryâ€™s economic situation will improve over the next 12 months, with roughly a third (34%) believing it will improve a lot. Individuals with higher levels of education are less optimistic about the future, however. About half (51%) of Brazilians who completed college believe the economy will improve, compared to 71% of those without university degrees.
