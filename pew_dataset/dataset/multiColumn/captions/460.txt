The 2020 presidential election is more than two months away, but many social media users in the United States already are exhausted by how much political content they see on these platforms.
Some 55% of adult social media users say they feel “worn out” by how many political posts and discussions they see on social media, according to a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults conducted July 13-19. This share has risen 18 percentage points since the Center first asked this question in the summer leading up to the 2016 presidential contest and 9 points just in the past year.
At the same time, users are less ambivalent about seeing these types of posts today than in the past. Today, 29% of social media users say they don’t feel strongly one way or another about encountering political discussions, down from about four-in-ten in 2016 and 2019. Across these surveys, including the latest, relatively small shares – ranging from 15% to 20% – have said they like seeing lots of political posts on social media.
The sense of exhaustion rather than excitement over seeing political content on social media holds true across political parties. But while there were no partisan differences on this question in 2016, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who use social media are more likely than users who are Democrats and Democratic leaners to say they are worn out by how many political posts they encounter on social media (63% vs. 49%). On the other hand, today Democratic social media users are twice as likely as their Republican counterparts to say they like seeing this kind of content on these platforms (20% vs. 10%), with this sentiment among Republican users falling 11 percentage points since 2016.
