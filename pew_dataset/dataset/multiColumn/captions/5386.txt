In the past 15 years, the percentage of women who work in newspaper newsrooms has barely budged. Women made up 36% of all newspaper staff in 2012 (the last year for which data are available), nearly unchanged from 37% in 1998, according to The American Society of News Editors’ annual census.
Virtually the same proportion of women (35%) worked in supervisory positions in newspapers in 2012, a number that has also barely changed since 1998, when it was at 34%. (At the Times itself, four of the top nine editors currently are women, even after Abramson’s departure.) It’s worth noting that these shares have remained the same during a period when newspaper newsrooms have been shrinking. Since 1998, nearly 17,000 of those jobs have been lost, according to ASNE.
