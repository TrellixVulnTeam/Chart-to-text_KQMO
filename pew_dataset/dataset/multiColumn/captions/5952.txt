A few months later, a Harris poll got a sense of how homosexuals were viewed by the public by asking whether homosexuals (and many other groups) were “more helpful” or “more harmful” to American life.
By a margin of 63% to 1%, Americans said homosexuals were more harmful than helpful; 25% said homosexuals neither helped nor harmed and 10% were not sure. This balance of opinion at the time put homosexuals in similar esteem as prostitutes and atheists – although not as negatively viewed as Americans who were members of the Communist Party. Among other groups, civil rights demonstrators recorded 25% support as being more helpful, but a 60% majority said they were more harmful. (For reference, among the full list of 18 types of people, “young people who spend most of their time reading books” had the most positive ratings, 48% to 8%.)
