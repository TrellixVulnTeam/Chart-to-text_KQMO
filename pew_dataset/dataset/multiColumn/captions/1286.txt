Republican views of the FBI have rebounded after declining in 2018: About two-thirds of Republicans (66%) now say they have a favorable opinion of the FBI â€“ up 17 percentage points since last July, but on par with views of the bureau in 2016 and early 2017.
Democratic opinions of the FBI are little changed in recent years, with roughly three-quarters (77%) continuing to say they view the bureau favorably.
