Trust in government has typically been higher among those associated with the party in control of the White House than among those who support the opposing party. This is true today as Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are now more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to say they trust the federal government to do what is right always or most of the time (28% vs. 15%, respectively).
Trust in government among Republicans has increased 17 points since October 2015. The current share of Republicans who say they trust the government at least most of the time (28%) is considerably higher than throughout much of the Obama administration and is on par with the share of Republicans who said this in 2007 and 2008. Still, GOP trust in government today remains significantly lower than it was throughout most of George W. Bush’s administration.
While Republicans’ trust in government has increased substantially over the last several months, Democratic trust in government is now as low as it has ever been in 60 years. Just 15% of Democrats say they trust the government in Washington to do what is right always or most of the time, a decrease of 11 percentage points since fall 2015.
