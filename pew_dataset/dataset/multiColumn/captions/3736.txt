In other countries with large numbers of displaced persons, many are refugees from elsewhere. For example, Turkey has more than 2.5 million Syrian refugees as of the end of 2015, accounting for most of Turkey’s nearly 2.8 million displaced people. And Pakistan has more than 1.5 million refugees from Afghanistan, making up more than half of the 2.7 million displaced people living within Pakistan’s borders.
