More than a quarter (28%) of smartphone owners say they do not use a screen lock or other security features to access their phone. And while a majority of smartphone users say they have updated their phone’s apps or operating system, about 40% say they only update when it’s convenient for them. Meanwhile, some users forgo updating their phones altogether: Around one-in-ten smartphone owners report they never update their phone’s operating system (14%) or update the apps on their phone (10%).
The story around mobile security is not all negative. Very few smartphone owners (3%) say they never update their phone’s apps or operating system or use a screen lock to access their phone. And some users are especially diligent when it comes to mobile security, taking the steps most recommended by cybersecurity experts. Around one-in-five smartphone owners (22%), for example, say they use a screen lock for their phone, update their apps either automatically or as soon as an update is available, and immediately update their device’s operating system when a new version is offered.
