Thereâ€™s a persistent partisan gap in sympathies for Israel and the Palestinians. Americans continue to express more sympathy for Israel in the dispute than for the Palestinians (54% vs. 19%), though the share sympathizing more with the Palestinians has risen 5 points since July 2014.
Both Republicans and Democrats are more likely to sympathize with Israel than with the Palestinians, though that margin is far wider among Republicans (75% vs. 7%) than among Democrats (43% vs. 29%). And within the Democratic Party, there are stark differences by ideology: A 53% majority of conservative and moderate Democrats sympathize more with Israel, but liberal Democrats are statistically divided in their views. While a third of liberal Democrats (33%) sympathize more with Israel, 40% express more sympathy for the Palestinians.
