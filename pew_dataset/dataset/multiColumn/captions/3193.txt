These data provide an incomplete answer. In addition to being asked how often their job makes them feel angry or frustrated, police officers were asked how often they feel fulfilled by their job. In a separate Pew Research Center survey of the general public conducted Aug. 16-Sept. 12, 2016, the 2,767 employed adults included in the survey were asked how often their jobs make them feel frustrated or fulfilled. The question measuring job-related anger was not asked in the general public survey, however.
Employed Americans, on average, express considerably less frustration on the job than do police. Only 29% of the public but 51% of officers say their job nearly always or often makes them feel frustrated. At the same time, the typical worker more often feels fulfilled by their work than do police officers (52% vs. 42%).
