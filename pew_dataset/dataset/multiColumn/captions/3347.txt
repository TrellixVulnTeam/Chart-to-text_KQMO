The opinions of police and the public also differ on some important issues facing the country. While a majority of the police and public support some gun control measures, roughly one-third of police (32%) but 64% of the public favor banning assault-style weapons. And while 67% of officers say the deaths of blacks in recent encounters with police are isolated incidents, less than half of the public (39%) shares this view.
