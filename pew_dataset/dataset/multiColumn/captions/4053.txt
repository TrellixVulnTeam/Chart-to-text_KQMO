Among this group, Democrats and Democratic-leaning Millennials are far more likely than Republican and Republican-leaning Millennials to learn about the election via social media, the new analysis finds. Nearly three-quarters (74%) of Millennial Democrats who say they are very likely to participate in their stateâ€™s primary or caucus learned about the 2016 presidential election through a social networking site. This is starkly higher than the 50% of Millennial Republicans who say they are very likely to participate. These party differences were not found in other generations.
