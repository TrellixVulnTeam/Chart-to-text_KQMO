3“Negative voting” is higher for Trump than it was for past GOP candidates. While most Republican voters say Trump does represent the party’s core principles, they are divided over whether they are mostly voting “for” him or “against” Clinton. In our most recent survey, 51% of registered voters supporting Trump say they see their choice as more of a vote against Clinton than a vote for Trump. That is the highest share of “negative voting” among supporters of Republican candidates dating back to George W. Bush’s first presidential race in 2000.
Among Clinton supporters, 57% view their choice as for Clinton, rather than against Trump. The share of Clinton’s backers who view their choice positively is less than the share of pro-Barack Obama voters who did so in 2008 (77%) or 2012 (73%), but much higher than the level of positive support for John Kerry in 2004 (39%).
