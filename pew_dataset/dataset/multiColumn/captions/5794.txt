Survey respondents who said they believe in God with no doubts also disagreed most strongly (61%) with the statement “In my opinion, life does not serve any purpose.” Those who said they were certain they did not believe in God or who expressed more uncertainty about their belief were less likely than strong believers to reject the statement that life has no purpose. (Only 49% said they strongly disagreed ). There were no statistically significant differences between those who were uncertain and those who did not believe in God.
