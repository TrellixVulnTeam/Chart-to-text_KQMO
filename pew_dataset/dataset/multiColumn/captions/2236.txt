In the U.S., views of NATO have surged among Democrats but generally remained steady among Republicans. Almost eight-in-ten (78%) approved of NATO in the 2017 survey – a 20-point increase from the 58% who approved in 2016. Democratic opinions of the alliance had generally remained stable in prior years. In contrast, just 47% of Republicans felt the same in 2017 – little changed from previous years. Roughly six-in-ten independents (59%) approved as of last year.
