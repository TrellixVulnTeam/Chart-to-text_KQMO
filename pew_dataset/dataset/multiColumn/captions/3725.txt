However, districts’ willingness to split their tickets – choose one party’s presidential nominee and the other party’s candidate for representative – has been on a steep decline for more than two decades. In 2012, only 26 House districts out of 435 (6%) split their votes, according to our analysis of district-level election results. Of these, 17 voted to re-elect President Obama but sent a GOP representative to Capitol Hill; nine opted for Mitt Romney and also a Democratic representative. (On an individual voter level, a Pew Research Center analysis in 2014 estimated that about eight-in-ten likely voters in areas with multiple major contests would vote a straight-party ticket that fall. Split-ticket voting also has declined at the state level.)
First, split-ticket districts were overwhelmingly Republican for the presidency but Democratic when it came to the House (a combined 92.6% of all split-ticket districts in the five election cycles between 1972 and 1988). And second, tickets in Southern districts were far more likely to be split than those in any other region: Of all districts that split their presidential and House votes between 1972 and 1988, 41.2% were from Southern states even though the South accounted for just 31.5% of all House seats. This was well above the shares in any of the other three Census-defined regions. In 1972, two-thirds of all Southern districts split their presidential and House votes; as recently as 1988 more than half still did.
