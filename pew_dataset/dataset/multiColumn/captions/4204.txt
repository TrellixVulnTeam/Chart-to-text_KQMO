One of the most dramatic shifts in recent years has been the rapid decline of the once-ubiquitous incandescent light bulb. Since the phase-out of standard incandescent bulbs began in 2012, their share of the residential light-bulb market has fallen dramatically: just 25% of total shipments so far this year, down from nearly two-thirds just two years ago, according to market-research firm IHS. Instead, people are buying more energy-efficient and longer-lasting alternatives, such as halogen and LED bulbs.
