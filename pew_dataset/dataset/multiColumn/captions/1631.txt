Democrats continue to be much more likely to say spending should be increased than Republicans â€“ about seven-in-ten Democrats (73%) say this, compared with just 27% of Republicans. The numbers saying this in both parties are largely unchanged since 2017, though both parties are more likely to say this than they were six years ago.
More than half of the public (55%) say they would increase spending on environmental protection if they were making up the budget for the federal government this year. This is larger than the 46% who said this in 2017 and much larger than the one-third of Americans who said they would increase spending in 2013.
The share of Democrats saying they would increase spending on environmental protection has risen steadily since 2011. And the nearly three-quarters (73%) who say they would increase spending today is 12-percentage points higher than it was two years ago.
Republican views are little different than they were in 2017. However, GOP support for increasing spending for environmental protection is significantly higher than it was in 2013 (29% say this now, compared with 11% then).
