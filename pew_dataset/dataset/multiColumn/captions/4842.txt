On the other hand, there is clear evidence that the general public and scientists often see science-related issues through different lenses. For instance, there is a 51-percentage-point gap between scientists and the public about the safety of eating genetically modified foods – 88% of AAAS scientists think eating GM food is safe, while just 37% of the public believes that. In addition, there is a 37-percentage-point gap over whether climate change is mostly caused by human activity – 87% of scientists say it is, while 50% of the public does.
