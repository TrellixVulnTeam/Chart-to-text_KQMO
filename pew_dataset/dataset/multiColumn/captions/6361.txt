The public has become increasingly critical of news organizationsâ€™ campaign coverage over the past two decades. Currently, about half (49%) rate media coverage of the campaign as excellent or good while about as many (45%) rate it as only fair or poor.
Four years ago, the balance tilted positive. More than half (55%) rated coverage as excellent or good just after Super Tuesday; 44% said it was only fair or poor. The positive numbers have edged downwards across partisan lines. At a comparable point in the 1992 campaign, 63% rated press coverage as excellent or good, while 34% said it was only fair or poor.
