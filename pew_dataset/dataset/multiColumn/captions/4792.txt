The survey finds that opinions of the 2010 health care law – which will soon face a major challenge in the Supreme Court – remain little changed: Public opinion continues to be closely divided, with views somewhat more negative than positive (53% disapprove, 45% approve).
Americans remain split over the law’s future: 50% say the law’s major provisions are “probably here to stay” while 45% think they “will probably be eliminated.” The divided views of the law’s fate also are largely unchanged over the past year. In April 2014, 49% said the law was probably here to stay while 43% said it would probably be eliminated.
