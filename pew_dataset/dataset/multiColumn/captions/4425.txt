A plurality in each of six Latin American countries surveyed (those listed earlier, plus Peru) say that Cuba will become more democratic over the next several years. A median of 47% say Cuba will embrace democracy, 27% say it will remain the same as now, and only one-in-ten say Cuba will become less democratic. In the U.S., 43% say that Cuba is bound for more democracy, although nearly half (49%) say that democracy in Cuba will remain about the same. Only 3% of Americans say Cuba will become less democratic.
