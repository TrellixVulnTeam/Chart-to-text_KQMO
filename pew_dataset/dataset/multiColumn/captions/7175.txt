The aftermath of the 22-day military conflict between Israel and Hamas drew considerable public interest. Three-in-ten (31%) say they followed news about conditions in the Gaza Strip very closely last week after the announcement of a cease fire. Public interest in this story was roughly equal to interest in the second week in January – following the start of the Israeli military’s ground invasion – when 34% of the public followed the conflict very closely. The inauguration and the financial crisis overshadowed Gaza in terms of public interest and media coverage. Still, one-in-ten listed the conflict between Israel and Hamas as the story they followed more closely than any other. For its part, the national news media devoted 4% of all coverage to this subject.
In economic news, the announcement of thousands of layoffs at several major American companies, including Microsoft, Intel and United Airlines, was very closely followed by a third (34%) of the American public. Attention to this news was comparable across gender, education levels and party affiliation. Some 6% cite the job cuts as the story they followed most closely last week. According to PEJ, the national media devoted 2% of the overall newshole to stories about unemployment and jobs.
Reports that Hillary Clinton was confirmed by the U.S. Senate and assumed the role of secretary of state attracted the very close attention of one-in-four Americans (24%). Clinton’s transition from the Senate to the new administration was the most closely followed story of the week for just 1% of the public.
