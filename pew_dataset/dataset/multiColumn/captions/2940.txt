Even before being charged with corruption, Brazilian President Michel Temer was less popular than his predecessors. Temer, Brazil’s current leader, has been charged with corruption amid allegations he participated in bribery. But even before the scandal, when Brazilians were asked about their views of the country’s current and previous presidents, Temer’s favorability trailed that of his immediate predecessors, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in March and April.
In the spring survey, about one-in-five (21%) Brazilians had a positive view of Temer, including only 2% who had a very favorable view of him. About a third (34%) of the public had a favorable view of Temer’s former boss, impeached President Dilma Rousseff. And more than four-in-ten (45%) had a positive opinion of former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is also under investigation.
