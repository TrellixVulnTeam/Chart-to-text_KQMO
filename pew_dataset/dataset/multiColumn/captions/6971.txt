Despite consistently high interest and the large percentage of Americans who say the issue affects them personally, the public continues to find the health care debate difficult to grasp. About seven-in-ten (69%) say health care reform is hard to understand, not much different from the 66% that said the same in early October. In the current survey, 29% say the issue is easy to understand, compared with 33% in the Oct. 2-5 survey.
