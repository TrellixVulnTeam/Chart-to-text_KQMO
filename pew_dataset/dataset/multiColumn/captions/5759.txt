But now, as the White House and Congress find themselves in yet another showdown over the budget and debt ceiling, Gallup reports that 33% of Americans now cite dissatisfaction with government and lawmakers as the nation’s top issue. That figure not only surpasses the economy (19%) and unemployment (12%), but is the highest such percentage dating back to 1939 for what Gallup describes as “dysfunctional government.”
Gallup said that the economy and jobs as the nation’s top problem had already been declining this year. But, in its survey conducted Oct. 3-6, Americans who mentioned some dissatisfaction with government leadership as the top problem doubled to the 33% mark, compared to 16% last month.
