The mismatch group is also significantly more likely to have changed residences in the past few years, making it more challenging for voter databases to maintain up-to-date records of their voting history. For example, those who have lived at least five years at their current residence are significantly more likely to have their self-reported vote match the voter record than those who have a shorter residential tenure (12% vs. 26%). Renters (27%) are twice as likely as homeowners (13%) to say they voted but to not have a record of voting.
