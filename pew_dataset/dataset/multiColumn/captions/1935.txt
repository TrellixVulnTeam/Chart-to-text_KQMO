Few Americans name Germany as their country’s most or second-most important foreign policy partner, but about a third of Germans name the U.S. Only 9% in the U.S. name Germany as one of their top two foreign affairs partners, far fewer than the 37% who name the UK and 26% who name China. Since 2017 the share of Americans saying Canada is their country’s first- or second-priority partner has increased to 25%. In fact, Germany is no longer among the top five countries cited by Americans.
