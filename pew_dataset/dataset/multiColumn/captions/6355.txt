The growing controversy over the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida was the publicâ€™s top story last week, though African Americans express far greater interest in news about the killing than do whites.
Overall, a quarter of Americans (25%) say they followed news about the African American teenager killed by a community watch volunteer more closely than any other story. Smaller percentages say they followed news about the presidential elections (16%) or the economy (15%) most closely, according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey, conducted March 22-25, 2012, among 1,003 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press.
