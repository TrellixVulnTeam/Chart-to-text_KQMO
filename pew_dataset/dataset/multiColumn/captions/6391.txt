About two-in-ten (22%) say they followed news about candidates for the 2012 presidential elections more closely than any other news last week. About as many (18%) say their top story was Barack Obama’s annual speech to a joint session of Congress on Jan. 24. Another 15% say they followed news about the nation’s economy most closely, according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey, conducted Jan. 26-29 among 1,006 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press.
By comparison, news coverage was not so evenly distributed. The 2012 campaign dominated coverage, accounting for a third of the newshole (33%), according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). The State of the Union made up 9% of coverage and the economy 6%.
