The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, conducted Dec. 1-16 among 2,000 Americans, finds a continuing decline in public perceptions of the situation in Iraq. Just half see the military effort in Iraq going very or fairly well, while nearly as many (46%) say things are not going well. A year ago, following the capture of Saddam Hussein, 75% said things were going well in Iraq, while just 22% saw the situation in negative terms. Public perceptions of the situation in Iraq were this low only for a short period following the Abu Ghraib prison scandal and the highly publicized murders of U.S. civilian contractors in Fallujah last April.
