Americans say the two news stories they followed most closely last week were the reinvigorated debate over health care reform in Washington and the second week of the Winter Olympics in Vancouver.
In interviews shortly after the Feb. 25 bipartisan summit on health care legislation, a quarter of the public (25%) says they followed the health care debate more closely than any other story last week. A comparable number (24%) say they followed the Winter Olympics most closely, according to the latest News Interest Index survey, conducted Feb. 26-March 1 among 1,008 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press.
The health care debate dominated news coverage last week, making up 24% of the newshole, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism. Among the other top stories were the economic crisis (11% of coverage), Toyota’s continuing problems (10%) and the Olympics (7%).
