About six-in-ten (59%) say they expect a bill to pass this year, while 29% predict a bill will not pass. This is little changed from mid-December, when 61% expected a bill to pass and 34% said a bill would not pass. Democrats are notably more likely to predict passage – 68% say health care legislative will pass – than are independents (58%) or Republicans (50%).
