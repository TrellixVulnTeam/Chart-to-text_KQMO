Barack Obama’s job approval is little changed over the last month, with Americans about equally likely to say they approve of his job performance (48%) as disapprove (46%). But his current ratings reflect a shift in a positive direction from last year. Obama’s rating among independents, in particular, has ticked higher in recent months; 45% of independents now approve of his job performance, similar to his rating last month (42%), but significantly higher than in December (39%) and throughout much of 2014.
