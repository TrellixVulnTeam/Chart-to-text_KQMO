The public continued to track stories about swine flu and its vaccine last week, with news about the flu trailing only health care reform in terms of public interest. About a third (32%) followed news about swine flu very closely and 20% name it their top story of the week. Women (39% very closely) were more likely to follow this story than men (25% very closely).
About two-in-ten (21%) followed news about a boy thought to be on a runaway balloon very closely. Some 14% say the balloon drama was their top story of the week.
Only modest interest was paid to news about recent gains in the stock market, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 10,000 points for the first time in more than a year. Some 15% followed stock market news very closely and 6% named it their top story. Interest in the stock market eclipsing 10,000 points was much lower than it was in mid-October of 2008, when the Dow fell below 10,000 points in the midst of a steep decline. A News Interest Index survey conducted October 10-13, 2008 found 59% paying very close attention to “recent major drops in the U.S. stock market.”
