With a Florida judge clearing the way for George Zimmerman to get out of jail on bail, developments in the case against the man charged in the killing of Trayvon Martin topped Americans’ news interest last week.
About a quarter of the public (26%) says they followed developments in the case more closely than any other news, according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey, conducted April 19-22 among 1,004 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The controversy over the shooting of Martin, an unarmed African American teenager, has now been the public’s top story for five straight weeks.
Coverage, though, dropped to 7% of the newshole from 17% the previous week, when Zimmerman was arrested and charged with second degree murder, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). The 2012 presidential campaign received the most coverage last week, accounting for 17% of the newshole.
About one-in-ten (9%) say they followed news about the emerging scandal more closely than any other news, ranking it behind developments in the Trayvon Martin case (26% most closely), the economy (15%) and the presidential campaign (13%) among the week’s top stories.
