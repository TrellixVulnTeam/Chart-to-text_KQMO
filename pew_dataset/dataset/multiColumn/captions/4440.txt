While itâ€™s nowhere near the top, 12% of online Americans cited The Daily Show as a place they got their news. This audience share was on par with that of USA Today (12%) and The Huffington Post (13%) among 36 different news outlets Pew Research Center asked about in a 2014 survey. Roughly equal shares of online Americans trust (16%) and distrust (18%) The Daily Show as a source of government and political news, but there is a strong ideological split in who trusts the show: Almost half (45%) of consistent liberals say they trust The Daily Show, while less than 1% of consistent conservatives say the same.
Liberals, men and college grads are more likely than conservatives, women and those without a college degree to get political and government news from The Daily Show. About a third (34%) of those with consistently liberal political views watch The Daily Show, compared with a mere 1% of those with consistently conservative political values. There is also a small gap between men and women: 15% of men get news about government and politics from The Daily Show, compared with 9% of women. And 16% of college grads report watching the Daily Show in the past week, higher than both those with some college (12%) and those with a high school degree or less (7%).
