Despite this imbalance in the coverage, the public has consistently expressed greater interest in news about events in Iraq than it has about the policy debate in Washington. Even in mid-September, shortly after Petraeus delivered his testimony, more Americans said they were following events in Iraq very closely than said the same about Petraeus’ report (31% vs. 25%).
The only point this year when the public showed a great deal of interest in the Washington policy debate was in mid-January, shortly after Bush’s announcement that he was sending more troops in Iraq (40% very closely). Even then, however, as many or more people said they were following news about events in Iraq very closely.
