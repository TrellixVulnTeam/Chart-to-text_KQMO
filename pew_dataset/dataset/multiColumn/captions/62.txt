Among all Hispanics, the share that was born in another country was 34.4% in 2015, down from a peak of about 40% earlier in the 2000s. The share of adult Hispanics who are foreign born began declining a bit later â€“ 47.9% of Hispanic adults were born in another country in 2015, down from a peak of 55.0% in 2007.
