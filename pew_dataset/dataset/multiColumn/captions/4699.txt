A majority of Americans have moved past Japan’s actions during WWII. More than a third say that Japan has apologized sufficiently for WWII and about a quarter hold the view that no apology is now necessary. Just 29% voice the opinion that Japan has not apologized sufficiently for its actions during the war. Again, it is younger Americans (73%) who are most likely to put Japan’s role in WWII behind them, while older Americans (50%) are less convinced.
