The EPA also suggests that people consider carpooling, mass transit, working from home or other alternatives to driving to and from work solo. But driving alone remains by far the most common commuting method: About three-quarters of Americans reported last year that that was their main commuting mode, a figure that’s changed little since 2000. (The share of solo-driving commuters actually has increased since 1980.)
The percentage of commuters who carpool has fallen by more than half, from 19.7% in 1980 to 9.2% last year. Also, a modest increase in telecommuting hasn’t been enough to make solo driving any less dominant.
