The American public expressed strong news interest in the earthquake in China last week even as the news media remained heavily focused on the presidential campaign. In spite of modest coverage of both the earthquake in China and the cyclone that hit Burma, the public had a fairly good sense of the magnitude of both disasters.
About one-in-five Americans (22%) say they followed news about the earthquake in China more closely than any other story last week, which is about the same percentage citing the presidential campaign as their top story (20%). By contrast, news organizations devoted much more coverage to the campaign – 37% of all news coverage – than to the China disaster (13%).
News about gas prices, which barely appeared on the news media’s radar, was the public’s top story. Roughly three-in-ten (31%) say they followed reports about rising gas prices more closely than any other story last week.
