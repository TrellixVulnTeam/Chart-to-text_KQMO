What is the state of American journalism? We have been studying the American news media for over a decade, following the industry through a tumultuous time as the rise of the internet upended a decades-old business model. This year’s State of the News Media report (the 11th edition) found new optimism in the industry due to the arrival of new digital players, the growth of new revenue streams and more evidence than ever that news is a part of the explosion of social media and mobile devices. But there’s also been a severe loss of jobs — particularly in newspaper newsrooms — and total revenue supporting American journalism has declined by one-third since 2006.
