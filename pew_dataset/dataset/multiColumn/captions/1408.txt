The surveyâ€™s four questions about Judaism included two about Jewish holidays, one about Jewish mysticism (Kabbalah) and one about Maimonides, a preeminent Jewish scholar of the Middle Ages. About eight-in-ten Jews or more know that the Jewish Sabbath begins on Friday (89%), that Rosh Hashana is the Jewish New Year (82%) and that Kabbalah is associated with Judaism (79%). The question about Maimonides was one of the toughest on the survey for Americans overall, but still, 58% of U.S. Jews know that Maimonides was Jewish. Jewish respondents correctly answer 3.1 of these four questions, on average.
By contrast, U.S. adults overall answer only about one (0.9) of these four questions correctly, on average. Three-in-ten (29%) know that the Jewish Sabbath begins on Friday, and about a quarter know that Kabbalah is associated with Judaism (27%) or that Rosh Hashana is the Jewish New Year (24%). Just 13% know that Maimonides was Jewish.
