Jason Collins, a center for the NBA’s Washington Wizards, was the second-most frequently mentioned gay or lesbian public figure in the general-population survey. Just before the survey was conducted, Collins became the first active male professional athlete in a major North American team sport to come out publicly as gay; he’s due to become a free agent next month. (The LGBT survey was conducted before Collins’ announcement.)
It’s worth noting, though, that almost four-in-ten Americans (38%) said they couldn’t name any gay or lesbian entertainers or public figures, including 61% of people age 65 and older.
