More than half of the public (55%) say this was the news they followed most closely last week. The Gulf coast spill now has been the most closely followed story for each of the past 12 weeks.
News about the spill again received more coverage than any other major story, accounting for 20% of the newshole. That is up from 15% one week earlier, but still below peak levels reached in May and June, when it accounted for one-third or more of coverage, according to the Pew Research Centerâ€™s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ).
