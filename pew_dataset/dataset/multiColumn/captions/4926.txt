One factor that has driven the interest of media companies in making big investments in local television is political ad spending, which after the Supreme Court’s Citizens United ruling seems to guarantee windfalls to local TV stations in even-numbered years.
In the third quarter, local TV station groups saw positive results tied to an influx of political advertising dollars. From January to mid-October 2014, total political ad spending for local TV was about $1.3 billion, according to a Television Bureau of Advertising (TVB) analysis of Kantar CMAG data.
Seven of the 12 companies report political advertising revenue separately from other types of revenue. For this group, political advertising in 2014 was more than eight times higher than the year before and the share of political advertising out of the total revenues rose to 8% in 2014 compared to just 1% in 2013. Media General enjoyed the strongest boost in the group, with an increase of more than 1,400%. Still, LIN Media’s political advertising revenues, which saw the smallest growth, were up 360%. Moreover, the group’s political advertising revenues rose 77% since the last midterm elections in 2010.
