But while that finding points to a general anti-incumbent mood in the country, it is often the case that these same voters regard their own representative differently. That’s why the telling number in the Tuesday’s survey is the 38% of voters who say they want their own representative to be defeated. That’s as high as this figure has been in two decades.
In the run-up to the 2010 election year, when Republicans regained control of the House, 29% of those surveyed had said they did not want to see their own lawmaker re-elected. In the September prior to the 2006 midterms, when Democrats won control of the House for the first time in 12 years, 25% had said they wanted their own representative ousted.
