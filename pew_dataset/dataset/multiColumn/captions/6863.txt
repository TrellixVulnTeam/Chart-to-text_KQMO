Despite the growth in cell-only households, the magnitude of possible non-coverage bias remains relatively small for the majority of measures tested. Of 72 questions examined, 43 of them show differences of 0, 1 or 2 percentage points between the landline and dual frame weighted samples. Twenty-nine of the differences are 3 percentage points or more, all of which are statistically significant. Seventeen of the differences are 3 percentage points. Only one difference is as large as 7 points, while four others are 5 points and seven are 4 points.
