However, the NCES data only run through the 2010-11 school year. That year there were 31 “school-associated violent deaths,” the fewest since the report’s coverage began in 1992-93. But that was before 20 students and six adults were killed at Sandy Hook. Based on preliminary counts from media reports, the report indicated that there were 17 subsequent school-associated violent deaths — 11 homicides and six suicides — between Sandy Hook and November 2013.
As the report notes, such incidents are as rare as they are tragic. In 2010-11, for instance, 11 children and youths (ages 5 to 18) were murdered at school, less than 1% of the 1,336 total homicides among that age group that year; suicides at school were even rarer.
