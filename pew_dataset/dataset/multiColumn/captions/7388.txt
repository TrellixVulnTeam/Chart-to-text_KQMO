Public interest in the 2008 presidential campaign reached a new high last week, despite the decline in press coverage. Fully 36% of the public followed news about the campaign very closely, and the same percentage say it is the single story they followed most closely this past week. As recently as Nov 23-26, 2007, roughly half as many Americans (20%) reported this close attention to the campaign. This is the highest level of interest recorded during this campaign cycle, and it is comparable to the percent of Americans who were closely following campaign news in March 2004 (35%) — after that year’s “Super Tuesday” Democratic primaries.
In other news last week, 22% of Americans followed news about the search for the killer of a pregnant Marine, while 16% listed this as the story they were following more closely than any other.
Roughly three-in-ten followed news about the situation in Iraq very closely, but only 7% listed this as their top story of the week. The national news media devoted a mere 1% of its overall coverage to the Iraq war last week. Bush’s trip to the Middle East drew modest public interest: 17% followed this story very closely and 3% listed it as their most closely followed story of the week.
