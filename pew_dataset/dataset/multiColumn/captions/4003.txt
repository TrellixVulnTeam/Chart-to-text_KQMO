The notion that a person can be Jewish even without observing the Sabbath or believing in God may be tied to the idea held by many Jews that being Jewish is more about ancestry or culture than about religion. Indeed, a plurality of Jews in Israel (55%) and a majority in the U.S. (62%) say this is the case for them personally, although 23% in each country say their Jewish identity is about religion and ancestry/culture equally.
About one-in-five Israeli Jews (22%) and a slightly smaller share of American Jews (15%) say being Jewish, to them, is primarily about religion. Orthodox Jews in both countries are particularly likely to take this position.
