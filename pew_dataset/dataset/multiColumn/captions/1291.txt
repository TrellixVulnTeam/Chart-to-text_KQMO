As of this past summer, roughly two-thirds of Americans said they would like to see tighter e-cigarette regulations. In a July 2019 Gallup survey, 64% of U.S. adults said laws and regulations covering e-cigarettes should be made more strict, while around a quarter (26%) said regulations should stay as they are now. Just 5% said these laws and regulations should be less strict.
Younger Americans – those ages 18 to 29 – were split on laws surrounding e-cigarettes: While roughly half (49%) said laws should be made more strict, 42% said laws should be kept as they are. By comparison, roughly two-thirds or more of older adult groups said regulations covering e-cigarettes should be made more strict.
