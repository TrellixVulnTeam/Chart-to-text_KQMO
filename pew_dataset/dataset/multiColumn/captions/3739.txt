The research: Declining response rates have been a fixation for pollsters, who track their ebb like hawks. While few would claim the single-digit rates are something to boast about, research thus far – including the 15-year track compiled by SSRS’s David Dutwin, below – has not suggested that decreasing response rates are leading to increasing error rates. On the other hand, one of the few types of nonresponse bias that has been consistently noted by researchers is the fact that those who participate in surveys are also more likely to participate in civic activities – they are more likely to be “joiners,” in other words. Our own Scott Keeter and Drew DeSilver have a wrap-up on the challenges of polling when fewer people are available to be polled, that covers this issue and others.
