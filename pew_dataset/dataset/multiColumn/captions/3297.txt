Democrats glumly approach a new era. For the first time in a decade, Democrats are shut out of power in Washington. Today, they are about as pessimistic about the new year as Republicans were four years ago, after Obama’s reelection. Just 24% of Democrats say 2017 will be better than 2016. By contrast, victorious Republicans are optimistic: 83% expect 2017 to be better than 2016.
The Democrats’ gloom also has affected their view of the economy: In December, just 15% said they expect the nation’s economy to improve over the next year, down from 35% last June. Republican economic optimism, by contrast, has soared: 75% predicted the economy would get better, more than double the share who said this in June (29%).
