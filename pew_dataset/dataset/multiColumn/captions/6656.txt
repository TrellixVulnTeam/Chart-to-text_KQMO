Republican intra-party divisions are particularly sharp over funding for education, Social Security and environmental protection. A third (33%) of Republicans and GOP leaners who agree with the Tea Party favor decreasing federal education spending, compared with just 4% of non-Tea Party Republicans. Instead, 64% of non-Tea Party Republicans want increased education spending, as do 78% of Democrats and Democratic leaners.
