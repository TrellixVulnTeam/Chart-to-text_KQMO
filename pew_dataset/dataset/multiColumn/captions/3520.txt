But the Japanese public has a mixed view of the trajectory of Japan’s role in the world. Only about a quarter (24%) believes Japan plays a more important role in the world today compared with 10 years ago. About a third (34%) says Japan plays a less important role. And 39% hold the view that Japan’s role is about as important today as it was a decade ago. (In comparison, 21% of Americans and 75% of Chinese think their country is more important.)
