One area where it appears that Republicans who rely most on Trump for COVID-19 news have heard his message is how susceptible people under the age of 18 are to becoming infected with the virus – a subject that has often surfaced in debates over reopening schools this fall. The president has at times claimed that the risk to young people is minimal; the CDC says it is “unclear” whether children are as susceptible to infection as adults.
Around six-in-ten Republicans (including leaners) who rely most on Trump and the task force for COVID-19 news (57%) say people under 18 are far less susceptible to becoming infected than adults, while 30% say they are about as susceptible. But Republicans who don’t rely the most on Trump for coronavirus news are much more divided: 39% say young people are far less susceptible than adults, and 41% say they are about as susceptible.
