Nearly identical percentages of Republicans (57%), Democrats (55%) and independents (56%) say that Iraqâ€™s internal rivalries have had a lot to do with the rising violence.
Republicans are more likely than Democrats to attribute current violence in Iraq to the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from the country. Half of Republicans say the U.S. troop withdrawal contributed a lot to the current situation, compared with 39% of independents and just 29% of Democrats.
