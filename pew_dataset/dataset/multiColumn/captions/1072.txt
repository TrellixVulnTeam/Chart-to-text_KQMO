Despite the declining share in some countries that view the Islamic Republic as a threat, some of its neighbors thought its influence was on the rise. When asked in 2017, a majority of Lebanese and Jordanians and more than half of Israelis said they believed Iran played a more important role in the Middle East at that time than it did 10 years prior. Sizable shares in Tunisia and Turkey agreed; in both countries people were more likely to say that Iranâ€™s stature in the region had grown than they were to say it stayed the same or declined.
