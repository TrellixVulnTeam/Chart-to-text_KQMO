Terrorism has declined a major national problem among members of both parties, especially Republicans. Republicans are nearly 30 points less likely to view terrorism as a very big problem than two years ago (38% now, 66% then). There has been a smaller decline in the share of Democrats saying this (31% now, 42% then).
