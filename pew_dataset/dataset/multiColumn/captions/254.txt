But as the state’s Hispanic population has grown more diverse over time, so too has its Hispanic electorate. Both Cuban Americans and Puerto Ricans have decreased as a share of Florida’s Latino electorate since 2008, while the share of those from other origin groups has increased (from 39% to 44% of eligible voters).
The number of Venezuelan eligible voters in Florida grew by 184% from 2008 to 2018 – the fastest growth of any Latino origin group, though they still only account for 2% of all Hispanic eligible voters in the state. Other groups that grew considerably faster than the statewide average include Peruvians (+109%), Ecuadorians (+106%) and Colombians (+102%). Again, however, each of these groups still makes up a relatively small share of the state’s Latino electorate (8% or less).
