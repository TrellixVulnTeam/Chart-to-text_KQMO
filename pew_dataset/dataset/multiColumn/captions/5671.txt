Support for the new health care law took a beating in November – particularly among Democrats – during a period when many Americans paid close attention to the heavy news coverage of its problem-plagued rollout, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation Health Tracking poll released today.
The biggest drop in support for the law was among Democrats, amid concerns among some party lawmakers that the troubles surrounding the law would exact a political toll in next year’s midterm elections. The Kaiser survey found that Democrats holding a favorable view fell from 70 percent in October to 55% in November. During Kaiser’s polling since the law was enacted in 2010, support among Democrats was mostly in the 60s and 70s, although prior to October, it had fallen to the high 50s earlier this year.
