In evaluating news coverage of different groups, pluralities of Americans say that coverage of poor people and Muslims is too negative, while somewhat smaller percentages say the same about coverage of blacks and Hispanics.
Among eight groups tested, whites and middle-class people are the only groups that majorities say are treated fairly by the press; 57% say that news coverage of whites is generally fair while 56% say the same about coverage of middle-class people.
Notably, about a third (32%) say that coverage of wealthy people is too positive â€” the highest percentage for any group included in the survey. About as many see coverage of the wealthy as too positive as say it is generally fair (31%).
