The new national survey by the Pew Research Center and USA TODAY, conducted August 14-17 among 1,000 adults finds wide partisan divides in views of the Iraq situation.
The public is split over whether the U.S. has a responsibility to act in response to the violence in Iraq: 44% say that it does compared with 41% who say it does not.
A month ago, more people thought the U.S. did not have a responsibility to address the violence in Iraq (55%) than said it did (39%).
