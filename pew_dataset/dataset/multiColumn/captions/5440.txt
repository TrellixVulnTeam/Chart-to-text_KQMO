While the journalism world conferred its top honor yesterday to the newspapers that reported on Edward Snowdenâ€™s National Security Agency leaks, the public remains divided over whether those classified leaks served the public interest.
In the recent survey, attitudes about the leaks varied by age. Adults ages 18-29 are more likely to say the leaks helped the public (57%) than hurt it (35%). Adults 30-49 are somewhat split, while those ages 50 and older are more likely to say the leaks harmed than helped the public.
