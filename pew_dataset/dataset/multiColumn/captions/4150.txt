Views of Obama’s handling of the threat of terrorism have always been strongly associated with partisanship. And his ratings have dropped across all partisan groups.
Today, Democrats continue to largely approve of Obama’s handling of the terrorist threat, though to a lesser extent than earlier in his presidency. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of Democrats now say they approve, while 29% disapprove. In May, 72% of Democrats approved of his handling of the terrorist threat.
Only 11% of Republicans approve of Obama’s handling of the threat posed by terrorism while nearly nine-in-ten (87%) disapprove.
Approval on this issue among independents has also reached a historical low. Only a third of independents (33%) now approve of the way Obama is handling the threat of terrorism; roughly six-in-ten (61%) offer a negative appraisal.
