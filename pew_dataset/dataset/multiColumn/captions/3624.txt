About two-thirds (65%) of people who are high in religious commitment (regardless of their particular religious affiliation) say an implanted device for healthy people would be meddling with nature and crossing a line we should not cross. By contrast, people who are low in religious commitment (who seldom pray or attend religious services and say religion is not important in their lives) are much more inclined to consider brain chip implants to be in keeping with other ways that humans have tried to better themselves over time.
