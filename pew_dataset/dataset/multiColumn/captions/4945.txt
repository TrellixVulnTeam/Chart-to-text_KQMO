The Hispanic population is expected to reach about 106 million in 2050, about double what it is today, according to new U.S. Census Bureau population projections. But the new Hispanic population projection for 2050 is lower — by nearly 30 million — than earlier population projections published by the bureau.
These demographic changes have implications for population projections. For example, in 2008, the bureau projected the Hispanic population in 2050 would be 133 million, about 35 million higher than the 2050 projection published by the bureau in 2000. But 2008 turned out to be a high-water mark for the 2050 Hispanic population projection. By 2012, the bureau’s projection had dropped to 112 million.
