About one-in-five Americans (22%) have contributed to a “crowdfunded” online fundraising project, while 3% have created their own fundraising project on one of these sites. Although large-scale fundraising projects get most of the attention in news stories, there are far more instances of people using crowdfunding platforms to help someone in need, often a person close to them. Roughly two-thirds (68%) of crowdfunding donors have contributed to a project to help a person facing a hardship or financial challenge, and around six-in-ten say they did so on behalf of an acquaintance, close friend or family member.
