This chart shows the proportion of workers who are unauthorized migrants in a selection among the CPS’ 52 “detailed industry groups” . The major industries shown are those where the proportion of unauthorized migrants exceeds the proportion in the workforce (4.3%).
There are fewer detailed industries with high concentrations and significant numbers of unauthorized workers than detailed occupations. The range of credential and educational requirements is generally broader for industries than for occupations. Nonetheless, there are some industries with very high concentration of unauthorized workers. For example, 26% of workers in the landscaping services industry are unauthorized; similarly, about 1 in 5 workers in meat/poultry packing is unauthorized. The following industries have more than twice the representation of unauthorized workers than the whole labor force.
