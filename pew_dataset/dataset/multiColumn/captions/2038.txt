Globally, internet use is much more common in wealthier countries. The percentage of people who are online in each country is highly correlated with countriesâ€™ gross domestic product per capita (PPP). Regionally, internet use is lowest in sub-Saharan Africa, where a median of 41% across six countries use the internet. South Africa (59%) is the only country in the region where at least half the population is online.
