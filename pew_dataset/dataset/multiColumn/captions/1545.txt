A slim majority of conservative and moderate Democrats say they are concerned more about too much focus on investigations (55%), while 43% say their greater concern is not enough focus. The balance of opinion is roughly the reverse among liberal Democrats: 52% say they are more concerned congressional Democrats will not focus enough on investigating the Trump administration, while 46% say they are more concerned they will focus too much on these investigations.
