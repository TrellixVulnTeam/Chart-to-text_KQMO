By 57% to 34%, Republicans younger than 50 support a policy to grant permanent legal status to immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally when they were children. By contrast, Republicans ages 50 and older are evenly divided (45% favor, 45% oppose). There is a similar divide by ideology: Most moderate and liberal Republicans (58%) support this immigration proposal, while conservative Republicans are split (46% favor, 44% oppose). Republican women are somewhat more likely than men to back this proposal, and Republicans who are college graduates express more support than those who have not graduated from college.
While majorities of nearly all Republican groups back substantially expanding the wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, those ages 18 to 49 are less likely to support this policy than those 50 and older (60% compared with 83%). And support for an expended border wall is significantly higher among conservative Republicans (81%) than among moderates and liberals (55%).
