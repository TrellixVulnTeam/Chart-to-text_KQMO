The public sees this gap as an ongoing fact of life. A separate survey conducted in April 2012 found that Americans agreed by a 76% to 23% margin with the statement that “today it’s really true that the rich just get richer while the poor get poorer.” That gap had grown since Aug. 2002 when the margin was 65% to 33%, but the size of it was not much different than it was in 1987.
