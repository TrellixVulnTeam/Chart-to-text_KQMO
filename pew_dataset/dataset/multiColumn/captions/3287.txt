While officers and the public differ on a ban on assault-style weapons, the views of both groups are closely aligned on other gun-control measures. For example, more than nine-in-ten officers (95%) and close to the same share of the public (87%) favor laws that would prevent the mentally ill from purchasing guns. About the same proportions of the police and the public favor background checks for people who buy firearms at a gun show or from a private individual (88% and 86%, respectively). A majority of police and a larger share of the public also support the creation of a federal database to track gun sales (61% and 71%, respectively).
