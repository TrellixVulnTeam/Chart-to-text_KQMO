Todayâ€™s military is comprised of service members who served during a wide range of eras, from World War II to the post-9/11 conflicts. But the share who served in pre-9/11 eras will dwindle in future decades.
In 2015, the largest share of veterans first served during the Vietnam era (33%). Projections from the Department of Veterans Affairs show the waning influence of veterans from the World War II, Korean War and Vietnam eras. By 2045, the largest share of living veterans will have first served in the post-9/11 Gulf War era (35%).
