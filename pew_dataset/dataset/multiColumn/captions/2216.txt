Nearly four-in-ten Americans (39%) say that if Kavanaugh is confirmed by the Senate to sit on the Supreme Court he would overturn the courtâ€™s Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing the right to abortion. Fewer (29%) say Kavanaugh would not vote to overturn Roe, while 32% do not express an opinion or say it would not matter.
In contrast, Republicans are divided: 39% say Kavanaugh would not vote to overturn Roe, while 27% say he would do this; 34% offer no response. There are no significant ideological differences among Republicans in these views.
