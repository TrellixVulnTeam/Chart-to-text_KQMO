Support for the increased use of fracking has declined.
Overall, 41% favored the increased use of fracking to extract oil and natural gas from underground rock formations while 47% are opposed, according to last Novemberâ€™s poll. In March 2013, there was more support (48%) than opposition (38%) to increased use of the drilling technique. Republicans support increased fracking far more than Democrats, by a 62% to 29% margin. There was a particularly dramatic change of views in the Midwest where increased use of fracking is now opposed by a 47% to 39% margin compared with the majority who favored its use in 2013.
