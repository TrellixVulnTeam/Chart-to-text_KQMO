Anti-incumbent sentiment among voters has been growing steadily over the last decade and, this year, it matches or exceeds the last several midterms. About two-thirds (68%) of registered voters said last month that they don’t want to see most House members re-elected and about a third (35%) don’t want to see their own representative returned to office. In the 2006 and 2010 midterms, about half of voters said they wanted to see most members of Congress defeated.
