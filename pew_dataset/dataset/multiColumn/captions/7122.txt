The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, conducted April 14-21 among 1,507 adults interviewed in English and Spanish on landlines and cell phones, finds that Obama’s job ratings on several specific domestic issues are on balance positive, but also reflect the division of opinion about many of his policies. For example, 60% approve of his handling of the economy generally, while 33% disapprove. Fewer (50%) approve of his handling of the budget deficit, compared with 39% who disapprove.
Obama gets better ratings on foreign policy and terrorism – issues on which he trailed John McCain during last year’s presidential campaign – than on health care, tax policy or the budget deficit. The balance of opinion regarding Obama’s performance on foreign policy and terrorism is largely unchanged since February.
