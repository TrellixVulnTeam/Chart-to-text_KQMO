Americans tend to be more skeptical of what effects climate change policies have on the economy. Some 30% of Americans say climate change policies help the U.S. economy, while a roughly equal share (31%) believes these policies generally hurt the economy. Another 36% say policies to reduce the effects of global climate change generally make no difference to the U.S. economy.
Conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are at odds on this question. A majority of conservative Republicans (66%) say these policies generally hurt the U.S. economy, compared with just one-in-ten liberal Democrats (11%). And while about half of liberal Democrats (53%) say climate change policies help the economy, only 8% of conservative Republicans say the same.
