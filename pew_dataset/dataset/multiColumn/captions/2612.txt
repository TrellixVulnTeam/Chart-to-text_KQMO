The Syrian civil war, now in its seventh year, pits many of the regionâ€™s key players against each other. Few are optimistic that the war will end within the next year, though many believe it will not last beyond the next five years.
Views are most optimistic in Jordan. Fully 80% expect the war in Syria to end sometime in the next five years, including 32% who think it will end within the year. Syrians living in Jordan are even more hopeful about the war in their homeland; 64% expect it will end within the year, 26% say it will end within the next five years and only 10% think it will continue for more than five years.
Roughly two-thirds in Israel say the war will be over within the next five years, and 48% in Lebanon agree.
