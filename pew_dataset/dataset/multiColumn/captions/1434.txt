Nearly nine-in-ten Republicans who make $75,000 or more (88%) now rate economic conditions as excellent or good â€“ including 45% who say the economy is in excellent shape. By comparison, only about half of Republicans with incomes of less than $30,000 (54%) rate economic conditions positively.
The income gap in perceptions of the economy among Republicans has grown considerably in recent years: In the fall of 2016, there were only modest differences in GOP ratings of the economy across income groups.
Among Democrats, the income gap in economic perceptions is more modest: About four-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners with family incomes of $75,000 or more (39%) say the economy is excellent or good; 26% of Democrats who make less than $30,000 say the same.
