But Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support increased spending for scientific research. Around six-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (62%) favor this now, up from 46% in 2013. Four-in-ten Republicans and Republican leaners support increased spending for scientific research today, up from 25% six years ago.
The partisan gap in views of spending for scientific research has grown over the long term. In 2001, there was no significant divide between the parties. In subsequent years, Republican support trended steadily downward before going up more recently. Democratic support remained relatively steady for more than a decade before rising significantly in a 2017 survey. The partisan gap in support for more federal spending on scientific research was 16 percentage points in 2011; it grew to 27 points in 2017 and now stands at 22 points.
