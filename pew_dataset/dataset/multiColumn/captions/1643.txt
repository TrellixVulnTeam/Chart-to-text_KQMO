When it comes to workplace automation that has already occurred, Americans are more likely to say it has hurt U.S. workers than helped them. Around half of U.S. adults (48%) say job automation through new technology in the workplace has mostly hurt American workers, while just 22% say it has generally helped, according to the 2018 survey. About three-in-ten (28%) say these advances have neither helped nor hurt U.S. workers.
