The 2010 congressional elections dominated news coverage last week, but not the public’s attention. Americans continued to focus most closely on news about the nation’s struggling economy and about four-in-ten (39%) say news reports portray the economy “about the way it really is.”
Looking at the public’s news interest last week, nearly three-in-ten (28%) say they followed news about the economy most closely, while 12% say they followed news about this year’s congressional elections that closely.
The media devoted 26% of its coverage to the November midterms, nearly three times the 9% of newshole taken up by economic news, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism.
