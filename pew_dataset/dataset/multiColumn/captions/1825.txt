The experiment found that respondents were more likely to say plenty of “jobs” were available in their community than they were to say plenty of “good jobs” were available (60% vs. 48%). While there are partisan differences in these views (Republicans had more positive views of job availability), both Republicans and Democrats are significantly more likely to say “jobs” are available than to say “good jobs” are.
