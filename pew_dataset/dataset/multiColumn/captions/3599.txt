Clear majorities of Democrats and independents who lean Democratic say that, regardless of religious objections, those providing wedding services should treat same-sex couples the same as other customers (67%), and that transgender people should be able to use facilities for the gender with which they currently identify (68%). In contrast, similar-sized majorities of Republicans and Republican leaners say that wedding-related business owners should be able to refuse service to same-sex couples on religious grounds (71%), and that transgender people should be required to use the public restrooms of the gender they were assigned at birth (67%).
