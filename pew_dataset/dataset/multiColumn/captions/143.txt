Trust in other people is relatively high in 14 advanced economies surveyed by Pew Research Center this past summer. But while a median of 62% of adults across these countries generally believe most people can be trusted, there are significant differences in these views by age, education and other factors, according to a new analysis of findings from the survey.
Overall, personal trust is highest in Denmark, where 86% say most people can generally be trusted. Majorities in 10 other countries agree, including about seven-in-ten or more in the Netherlands, Canada, Sweden, Australia and the UK.
People are more divided in Spain and France, where 53% and 50%, respectively, say most other people can be trusted. The only country where fewer than half of respondents say most people are trustworthy is Italy, where 43% hold that opinion.
