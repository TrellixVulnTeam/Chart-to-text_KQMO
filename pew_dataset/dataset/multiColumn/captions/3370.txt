Millennials are projected to surpass Baby Boomers in 2019 as the nation’s largest living adult generation, according to our analysis of U.S. Census Bureau population projections. Millennials, whom we define as those ages 20 to 35 in 2016, now number 71 million, approaching the 74 million Baby Boomers (ages 52 to 70). And Generation X (ages 36 to 51 in 2016) is projected to pass the Boomers in population by 2028. The Millennial generation continues to grow as young immigrants expand its ranks. Boomers – whose generation was defined by the boom in U.S. births following World War II – are older and shrinking as a share of the population as the number of deaths exceeds the number of older immigrants arriving in the country.
