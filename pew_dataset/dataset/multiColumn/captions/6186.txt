When asked to assess the impact of their cell phone on various aspects of daily life, cell owners see some clear benefits — particularly when it comes to maintaining connections to friends and family:
When it comes to their attitudes compared with other types of cell owners, these groups are more positively inclined towards the benefits of mobile devices, but also more attuned to the potential downsides of ubiquitous mobility. They are more likely to say that their cell phone saves them time because they always have instant access to information, and more likely to say that they “can’t imagine living without” their cell phone. They also respond positively to the notion that their phone helps them be connected with others, schedule their lives, and be productive when they might not be otherwise. At the same time, these groups are also more likely to worry that they are spending too much time with their phone, to say that their phone makes it harder to focus on a single task without being distracted, or to say that their phone makes it harder to give people their undivided attention.
