U.S. Hispanics say relief from the threat of deportation is more important than a pathway to citizenship.
Among U.S. Hispanics, a larger share — by 56% to 35% — said in a Sept.-Oct. 2014 survey that it is more important that unauthorized immigrants be able to live and work in the U.S. without threat of deportation than have a pathway to citizenship. Among Hispanic adults, immigrants (59%) are more likely than U.S.-born Hispanics (54%) to say that being able to live and work legally is more important. Among Latino registered voters, 51% say deportation relief is more important than a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Meanwhile, four-in-ten Latino voters say the opposite.
