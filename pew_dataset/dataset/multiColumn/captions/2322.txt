Urban and rural residents see drug addiction as a major problem in their communities. About half of urban (50%) and rural (46%) residents say drug addiction is a major problem where they live (35% of suburbanites say the same). Across all community types, those without a bachelorâ€™s degree are more likely to see drug addiction as a major local issue.
