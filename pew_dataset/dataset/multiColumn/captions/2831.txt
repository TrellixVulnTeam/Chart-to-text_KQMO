While the library is seen as one useful resource, the survey also found that 55% of adults say that training to gain confidence in using computers, smartphones and the internet would help in making decisions.
Blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to believe training would help them, both in how to use online resources and in gaining confidence with digital tools. Similarly, those with less than a high school diploma are more likely than those with at least a bachelorâ€™s degree to think training would help. And women are slightly more likely than men to express this view.
