Nearly a year into Trump’s presidency, there has been a substantial increase in the share of Democrats expressing anger at the federal government. Currently, 29% of Democrats say they are angry at the government, which equals the share saying this in October 2006, before the midterm elections that year.
About one-in-five Republicans (19%) say they are angry at the government, which is much lower than the share saying this through most of Obama’s administration. However, the share of Republicans expressing anger at the federal government is higher today than at points during the first six years of Bush’s presidency (question was not asked later in his administration).
