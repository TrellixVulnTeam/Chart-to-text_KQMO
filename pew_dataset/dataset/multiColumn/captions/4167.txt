Wire services like the Associated Press account for the major share of federal government coverage in local newspapers. Regardless of whether a local newspaper has its own D.C. correspondent, wire service coverage carries much of the weight when it comes to informing readers about the federal government. Among the four papers with a D.C. correspondent, fully 52% of stories about the federal government came from wire services, compared with 8% that came from the D.C. correspondents. Among four papers studied without their own D.C. correspondent, reliance on wire coverage was even more pronounced â€“ accounting for fully 62% of all federal government news.
