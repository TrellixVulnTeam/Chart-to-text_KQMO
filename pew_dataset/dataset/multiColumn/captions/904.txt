Consider how views of Americaâ€™s presidents have changed in one country that has seen some especially dramatic swings: Germany. In 2008, at the end of the George W. Bush administration, just 14% of Germans said they had confidence in the U.S. president to do the right thing regarding world affairs. After Barack Obama took office the following year, the share of Germans with confidence in the U.S. president soared to 93%, and at least seven-in-ten Germans continued to express confidence in Obama throughout his eight-year tenure. But after Trump became president in 2017, the share of Germans with confidence in the U.S. president tumbled to just 11%, and it has not changed much since. The pattern has been similar in other large European countries, including the UK, Spain and France.
