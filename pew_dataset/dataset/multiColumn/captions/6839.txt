The public remained focused on the unfolding environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico last week, while the media divided its attention between two top stories: the oil leak and controversial comments by Gen. Stanley McChrystal that led to his ouster as commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
More than half of the public (53%) says they followed news about the Gulf coast oil leak more closely than any other major story. Just 7% say they followed news about the generalâ€™s comments and resignation most closely, according to the latest News Interest Index survey conducted June 24-27 among 1,001 adults by the Pew Research Center.
