Mexicoâ€™s military continues to be highly rated, with about six-in-ten (61%) saying the military has a positive impact on the way things are going in the country.
Roughly half or more list the media, national government and religious leaders as positive influences in Mexico, mostly unchanged from a year ago.
Rounding out the bottom of the list, only about one-third or fewer name the court system, Congress and police as good influences. Views of the court system and Congress remain relatively unchanged since last year.
