While the birth rate has declined among both U.S.-born and foreign-born women, immigrant women saw the biggest decline, from 90.7 births per 1,000 women in 2000 down to 77.4 in 2017. Among U.S.-born women, the birth rate dropped from 60.9 to 56.2. Still, immigrant fertility remains far higher than that of the U.S. born â€“ as has long been the case.
