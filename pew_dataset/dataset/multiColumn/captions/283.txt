Both McConnell and Schumer draw positive ratings from members of their own parties. Still, fewer than half of Republican and Republican-leaning independent voters (46%) say they have warm feelings toward McConnell, while about a quarter rate him coldly (26%) and 28% offer a neutral score of 50 on the thermometer. Schumer’s ratings among Democrats and Democratic leaners are similar: 46% warm, 26% cold, 27% neutral.
The ratings for both Senate leaders are more positive among the most ideological members of their parties. A 56% majority of conservative Republican voters view McConnell warmly, compared with just 20% of moderate and liberal Republicans. Schumer is much more popular among liberal Democrats (60% of whom give him a warm rating) than among his party’s conservative and moderate voters (33%).
Most striking of all may be the negative ratings that both Senate leaders – and especially McConnell – receive from voters in the opposing party, particularly those who are strongly ideological. McConnell gets warm ratings from just 2% of Democratic voters, while 77% say they have very cold feelings toward him. And among liberal Democrats, 89% feel very coldly toward him.
Schumer’s ratings among Republicans are less intensely negative. Still, a large majority of Republicans (69%) feel very coldly toward Schumer, including 78% of conservative Republicans.
