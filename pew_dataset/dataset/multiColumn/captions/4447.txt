Chinese views of Russia have also dipped in the past year. About half of Chinese (51%) have a favorable opinion of Russia, down from nearly two-thirds in 2014. But the Chinese public’s views of Russia have merely returned to their long-term norm after a one-year spike. Meanwhile, Russian views of China have improved markedly, rising from 64% in 2014 – roughly the level they had been at since 2007 – to 79%.
