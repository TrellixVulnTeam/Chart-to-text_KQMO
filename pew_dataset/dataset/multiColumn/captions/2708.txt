Freedom of choice, family widely viewed as essential elements of American dream
While people differ on the meaning of the American dream, very few – just 11% of the public – say “being wealthy” is essential to their own view of it.
By contrast, majorities say “freedom of choice in how to live” (77%), having a good family life (70%) and retiring comfortably (60%) are essential to their view of the American dream.
Smaller shares say making valuable community contributions (48%), owning a home (43%) and having a successful career (also 43%) are essential to their view of the American dream, but relatively few (no more than 9%) say these are not important to the American dream.
