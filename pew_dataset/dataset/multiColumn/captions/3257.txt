In early January, 46% of the public said “a large number of refugees leaving countries such as Iraq and Syria” was a major threat to the well-being of the U.S. About a third (35%) considered this a minor threat, while 16% said this was not a threat.
Older adults were far more likely than young people to view the large number of refugees from Iraq and Syria as a major threat. A majority of adults 50 and older (58%) viewed the large number of refugees from nations such as Iraq and Syria as a major threat, compared with 43% of those ages 35 to 49 and just 31% of those younger than 35.
