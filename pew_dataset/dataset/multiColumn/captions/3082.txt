The public continues to express frustration with the federal government, rather than anger or contentment. A majority of Americans say frustration (55%) best describes their feeling toward the federal government, while about two-in-ten say they are angry (22%); a similar share (19%) say they are basically content.
Overall, attitudes toward the federal government today are virtually identical to a year ago. In March 2016, 57% said they felt frustrated with the federal government, while 21% said they were angry and 20% said they were basically content.
