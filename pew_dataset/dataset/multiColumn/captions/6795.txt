Ratings for Obama’s performance on this issue are decidedly poor in the six predominantly Muslim nations included in the survey, and they are particularly negative in the three Arab nations polled that border Israel — more than eight-in-ten Lebanese (90%), Egyptians (88%) and Jordanians (84%) say they disapprove. On many questions, including questions about America’s image, there are sharp divisions among Lebanon’s major religious groups, but on this issue there is little disagreement — 84% of Lebanese Sunnis, 87% of the country’s Christians and a remarkable 100% of Shia respondents disapprove of the way Obama has handled the Middle East conflict.
About two-thirds in Turkey (66%) and half (51%) in Pakistan also hold this view. In both of these countries, only 5% approve of Obama’s performance, while large numbers offer no opinion.
Even in Indonesia, where Obama’s connection to the country — he lived there for several years as a child — typically boosts his ratings as well as America’s overall image, 56% disapprove of how he has handled the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.
