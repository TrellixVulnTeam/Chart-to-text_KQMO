The widening partisan gap has been largely driven by liberal Democrats, who have become much more negative in their views. Just 40% of liberal Democrats currently have a favorable view of the Supreme Court – the lowest percentage among this group in at least 15 years. Liberal Democrats are now far less likely than conservative and moderate Democrats (57% favorable) – or Republicans regardless of ideology – to view the court positively.
