There is a substantial – and growing – partisan divide on abortion, with Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party much more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners to support legal abortion in all or most cases (82% vs. 36%). There also are large gaps based on religious affiliation. For example, three-quarters of white evangelical Protestants (77%) say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases, while an even larger share of religiously unaffiliated Americans (83%) take the opposing view, saying that abortion should be mostly or entirely legal.
