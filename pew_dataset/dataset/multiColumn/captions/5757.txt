Pew Research surveys dating back 25 years, consistently show that the public, as a general proposition, likes political leaders who are willing to make compromises. In our April 2012 survey, fully 80% said they wanted leaders who were willing to compromise to get things done and just 16% disagreed. Democrats have always been more supportive of this idea than Republicans (90% of Democrats last year wanted leaders who compromised), but about two-thirds of Republicans consistently express this desire as well (68%).
