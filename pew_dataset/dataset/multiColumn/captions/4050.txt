The economic differences within parties are striking. Republicans and Republican leaners with family incomes of $100,000 or more are more likely than any other income group in either party to say the system is fair to most Americans: 60% of Republicans with incomes of at least $100,000 express this view, compared with no more than about four-in-ten Republicans in lower income categories.
Among Democrats, the pattern is reversed. Higher-income Democrats and Democratic leaners are the most likely to say the economic system in this country unfairly favors powerful interests: 82% of Democrats with a household income of $100,000 or more say this; just 17% say the system is typically fair to “most Americans.”
