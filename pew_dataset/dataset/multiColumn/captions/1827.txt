Another kind of survey experiment involves randomly assigning different answer choices to survey questions. A recent survey by the Center asked Americans whether Trump or Democratic congressional leaders should take the lead in solving the nation’s problems. One group of respondents saw only two possible answers: Trump or Democratic leaders. But another group saw an additional answer: both.
The experiment showed one consistent pattern: Regardless of the answer options, a greater share of the public said that Democrats should take the lead than said Trump should take the lead. But in the version of the question in which “both” was an explicit option, a 54% majority of Americans chose that response.
