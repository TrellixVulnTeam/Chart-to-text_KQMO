The latest national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted Jan. 4-9 among 1,502 adults, finds little optimism that the countryâ€™s political divisions will subside any time soon: 40% expect the country to be about as politically divided in five years as it is today, while 31% think it will be even more divided; just 24% expect divisions to lessen.
When asked a more general question about the year ahead, public views are mixed: 49% think 2017 will be a better year than 2016, while 42% think it will be worse. Expectations for 2017 are about as negative as for any year over the last decade. Compared with a year ago, optimism among Republicans has surged, while views among Democrats have plummeted. Fully 83% of Republicans and Republican leaners expect 2017 to be better than 2016; a year ago, 44% expected a better year in 2016 than 2015. By contrast, just 24% of Democrats and Democratic leaners expect a better year in 2017 (65% thought 2016 would be better than 2015).
