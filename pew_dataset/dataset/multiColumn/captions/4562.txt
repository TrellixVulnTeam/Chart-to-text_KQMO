Russians are split on Eurasian Economic Union membership for Ukraine, and they want the Donbas region of that country to secede. Only 45% of Russians say Ukraine should join the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), a supranational body that consists of Russia, Armenia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, with Kyrgyzstan as an acceding state. Four-in-ten Russians are opposed to Ukraine joining the EEU. However, few Russians want Ukraine to join NATO (3% support) or the European Union (14%).
