Support for conducting all elections by mail has risen among several groups – but not Republican men. Two years ago, similar shares of men and women in each party expressed support for vote-by-mail elections. Today, there is now a gender gap in views within the GOP.
In 2018, roughly a quarter of Republican men (24%) and GOP women (28%) said they favored conducting all elections by mail. There has been no change in support for the proposal among Republican men over the last two years, but support has risen by 13 percentage points among Republican women – from 28% then to 41% today.
Among both Democratic men and women, support for the proposal has risen by roughly 30 points over this period. Today, about seven-in-ten say they strongly or somewhat favor conducting all elections by mail today, up from about four-in-ten in 2018.
