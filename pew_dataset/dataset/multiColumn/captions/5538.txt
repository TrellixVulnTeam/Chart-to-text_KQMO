The last two monthly jobs reports were, as they say, nothing to write home about. U.S. payrolls expanded by just 113,000 jobs in January, far weaker than economists had predicted, after gaining just 75,000 jobs in December. The unemployment rate edged lower to 6.6%, the lowest level since October 2008 but still well above pre-Great Recession levels. And average weekly earnings, $832.82, were just 1.9% higher above their level a year earlier; annual wage growth (measured December-to-December) has been below 3% for the past six years.
In a Pew Research survey last month, just 16% of people rated economic conditions as “excellent” or “good,” while 45% rated them “only fair” and 39% “poor.” And according to a new report out today, 33% of people said they’re hearing mostly bad news about the economy, compared with 61% saying the news is mixed and only 5% saying it’s mostly good.
