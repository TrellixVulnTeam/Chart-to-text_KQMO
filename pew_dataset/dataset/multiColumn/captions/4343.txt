An estimated 746,000 Hispanics of Spanish origin resided in the United States in 2013, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.
Spaniards in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Spanish origin; this means either they themselves are Spanish immigrants or they trace their family ancestry to Spain.
Spaniards are the ninth-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States, accounting for 1.4% of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2013. Since 2007, the Spanish-origin population has more than doubled, growing from 353,000 to 746,000 over the period. At the same time, the foreign-born population of Spanish origin living in the U.S. almost doubled, from 60,000 in 2007 to 106,000 in 2013. In comparison, Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, constituted 34.6 million, or 64.1%, of the Hispanic population in 2013.
