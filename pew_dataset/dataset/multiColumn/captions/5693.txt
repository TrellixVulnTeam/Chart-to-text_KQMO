Levels of deprivation are relatively high in the African nations surveyed. Half or more report that there have been times in the last year when they have been unable to afford food for their families in Uganda, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Kenya, and Senegal. Somewhat fewer say this in Egypt and Tunisia.
Overall, there is a strong correlation between the percentage of people in a country who say they have not been able to afford food at some point in the last year and that countryâ€™s per capita gross domestic product, measured in terms of purchasing power parity, or PPP.
As one might expect, struggling to afford food is much less common in wealthier countries such as Canada, Australia, Japan, and Western European nations. The United States, however, has a higher percentage of people reporting difficulties buying food than its per capita income level would predict.
