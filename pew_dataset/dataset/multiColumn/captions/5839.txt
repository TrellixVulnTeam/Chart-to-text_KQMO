Race relations in the United States are a work in progress, as always, but most blacks, whites and Hispanics say they get along reasonably well with each other.
In the Pew Research Center’s recent report on race in America, 81% of whites and 73% of blacks say those two groups get along “very” or “pretty” well. When the same question was asked six years ago, 77% of whites and 69% of blacks said their groups generally got along well together.
