The gap exists even though Muslims in the region have made considerable gains in formal schooling in recent generations. Between the oldest and youngest adults in this study (those ages 55 to 74 and 25 to 34 in 2010), the share of Muslims in sub-Saharan Africa with at least some formal schooling (one year of primary schooling or more) doubled, rising from 21% to 43%. But these gains have not been as large as those made by Christians over the same period. As a result, the Muslim-Christian gap has actually widened across generations.
