Overall, 19% of the public say they followed the protests very closely, matching the number that said this one week earlier. Slightly more Democrats say this than Republicans (21% vs. 14%). News about the protests – which last week included confrontations with police in Oakland and Atlanta – accounted for 5% of the newshole. That’s down from the week of Oct. 10-16, when the story accounted for 10% of coverage.
The top foreign stories attracted less interest. Overall, 7% say their top story was the situation in Libya after the death of that country’s ousted leader, Moammar Gadhafi; 14% say they followed this news very closely. On both measures, there is little difference among partisans. News about Libya accounted for 4% of coverage, down sharply from 17% one week earlier when Gadhafi was captured and killed.
Interest in the ongoing financial crisis in Europe remains limited. Just 4% say the efforts to deal with the debt crisis in Greece and other European countries was their top story; 12% say they followed this news very closely. Partisans showed comparable interest on both measures. News about the debt crisis accounted for 5% of coverage.
