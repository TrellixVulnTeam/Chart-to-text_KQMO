In addition, vaping increased among college students from 2017 to 2018, the most recent year for which MTF has released data for this group. In fact, the uptick in vaping among college students for nicotine (from 6% in 2017 to 16% in 2018) and marijuana (from 5% to 11%) were among the greatest one-year increases for any substance asked about since the survey was first administered in 1975. (The long-running annual survey is first distributed to a nationally representative sample of students in eighth, 10th and 12th grades, and a randomly selected sample from each senior class continues to receive surveys biannually after finishing high school.)
Nicotine was the most commonly cited substance being used in e-cigarettes for most groups of students in 2018. Vaping just flavoring, by comparison, was more common for 12th graders (14%), 10th graders (13%) and eighth graders (8%) than for college students (5%) in the previous month.
