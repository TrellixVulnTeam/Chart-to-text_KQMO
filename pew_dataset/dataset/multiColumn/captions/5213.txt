A majority of Mexicans remain unhappy with conditions in their country. Fully two-thirds are dissatisfied with the way things are going in Mexico today. Only 30% are satisfied with the countryâ€™s direction. This is largely unchanged from last year (29% satisfied, 69% dissatisfied) and continues a trend of general malaise going back to when the question was first asked in 2002.
