It remains to be seen whether the strengthened faith that some Americans are experiencing will translate into greater service attendance, since most houses of worship are closed due to nationwide social distancing recommendations. Indeed, among U.S. adults who say they typically attend religious services at least once or twice a month, just 3% say their congregation is still holding in-person services. The vast majority (91%) say their congregation has closed its religious services to the public, and 5% say they do not know what their congregation has done.
Vast majorities of churchgoing Christians, those who attend worship services at least once a month, report that their congregation has been closed, including nine-in-ten or more among evangelical Protestants (92%), Catholics (94%) and mainline Protestants (96%). A somewhat smaller majority of those in the historically black Protestant tradition say their church has closed due to the outbreak (79%).
