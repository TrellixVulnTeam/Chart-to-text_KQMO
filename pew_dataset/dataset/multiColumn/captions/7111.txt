News about the spread of the H1N1 virus – and uncertainty about its potential danger – grabbed people’s attention in a busy news week that also included the bankruptcy filing by Chrysler, the 100th day of the Obama presidency and a party switch by veteran senator Arlen Specter. Still, close to four-in-ten (39%) say they followed news about the virus more closely than any other story.
Reporting about the swine flu also dominated news coverage. According to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism, reporting on the virus accounted for 31% of the newshole examined. No other story came close.
