The chart above summarizes the results for one of LAPOPâ€™s coup-related questions from its most recent biennial AmericasBarometer survey, about whether high unemployment would justify a coup. The 2008 AmericasBarometer survey found that between 36.3% (Uruguay) and 71.2% (Guyana) said high levels of crime would justify a coup; in the 2010 survey, the percentage of people saying high levels of corruption would justify a coup ranged from 20.8% in Argentina to 58% in Belize. (The black dot on each bar represents the percentage of people in each country who say high unemployment would justify a coup. The grey band on either side of the dot represents the 95% confidence interval, which means that in 95 out of every 100 samples of the same size and type, the result would fall somewhere within the grey band.)
