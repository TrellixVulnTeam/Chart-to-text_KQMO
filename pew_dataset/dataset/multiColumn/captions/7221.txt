Throughout the general election campaign, Pew’s Weekly News Interest Index asked Americans which candidate they had been hearing the most about in the news in the last week or so. Obama dominated McCain by a roughly seven-to-one margin through most of the summer. McCain was the more visible on only two occasions: the week of the Republican convention and the week immediately following. From that point on, Obama gradually rebuilt his lead. Last week, 64% of the public said Obama was the candidate they had been hearing the most about in the news; only16% named McCain.
While Americans consistently said they were hearing more about Obama than McCain, news coverage of the candidates was more balanced. Early in the summer, the media devoted significantly more coverage to Obama than to McCain, according to Pew’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). By late August, though, the two candidates were receiving roughly the same amount of national news coverage.
Public perceptions of Obama’s visibility tracked closely with media coverage of his campaign. For McCain, even in the post convention period when his coverage was comparable to coverage of Obama, public perceptions of his visibility were considerably lower.
With polls showing Obama running strongly in the last days of the campaign, the Democrat dominated in both coverage and visibility. According to Pew’s PEJ, Obama was featured prominently in 70% of campaign stories; McCain was featured in 52%.
