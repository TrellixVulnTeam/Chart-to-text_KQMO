In the wake of widespread disillusionment over the protracted conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly half of Americans say the country should mind its own business internationally and leave other countries to get along as best they can on their own â€” one of the highest readings of isolationist sentiment in decades.
Isolationist sentiments spiked briefly following the end of the Vietnam War and again after the collapse of the Soviet Union, but in recent years the percentages of Americans wanting the U.S. to mind its own business internationally has ranged from 42% to 49% (most recently 46%, in 2011), compared to an average of 36% over the 50-year study period. That, Kohut said, represents one of the highest measures of isolationist sentiment since the question started to be asked.
