During the week of the Pennsylvania primary, the national media focused heavily on the presidential campaign. News of the campaign eclipsed most other stories â€“ as the media devoted 44% of its overall coverage to the presidential race, up from 31% the previous week. Public interest ticked up only modestly: 34% followed campaign news very closely up from 29% the previous week. One-in-four listed the campaign as the single news story they followed more closely than any other, placing it on par with rising gas prices. The gap between interest in campaign news and coverage of the campaign is larger than it has been in recent weeks.
