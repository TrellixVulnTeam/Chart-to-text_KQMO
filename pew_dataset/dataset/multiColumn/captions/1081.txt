People who live in places with abortion clinics nearby are much more likely to say it is easy for someone in their area to obtain an abortion than those who live further away. Three-quarters of those within 5 miles of an abortion clinic say it is at least somewhat easy for someone to obtain an abortion in their area, while 47% of those who live 50 miles away from the nearest clinic say this. This pattern is similar among both Democrats and Republicans.
