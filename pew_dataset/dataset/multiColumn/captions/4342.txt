An estimated 248,000 Hispanics of Venezuelan origin resided in the United States in 2013, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.
Venezuelans in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Venezuelan origin; this means either they themselves are Venezuelan immigrants or they trace their family ancestry to Venezuela.
Venezuelans are the 13th-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States, accounting for 0.5% of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2013. Since 1990, the Venezuelan-origin population has grown more than fivefold, going from 49,000 to 248,000 over the period. At the same time, the foreign-born population of Venezuelan origin living in the U.S. grew by 388%, up from 35,000 in 1990 to 170,000 in 2013. In comparison, Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, constituted 34.6 million, or 64.1%, of the Hispanic population in 2013.
