The recent price increases also come at a time of continued interest in the health of the U.S. economy; 14% say they followed news about the economy most closely last week. Not including news about budget fights at the state and federal levels, news about the economy accounted for 3% of the newshole.
Fewer say they very closely followed news about a deadly earthquake in New Zealand (20%) or recent developments in the debate over gay marriage (19%). Five percent say they followed news about the earthquake more closely than any other top story, while 4% say they followed news about gay marriage developments that closely. Each of these stories accounted for 4% of coverage last week, according to PEJ.
