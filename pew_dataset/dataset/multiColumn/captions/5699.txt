Five years ago today, on November 4, 2008, Barack Obama won the presidency and became our first African American president. The historic moment may not have come as a surprise to many. Twenty years ago, about half of Americans (54%) thought the chances were good that we would have a black president by now, according to a 1993 Gallup/CNN/USA Today survey of U.S. adults, while 45% thought the chances were slim.
In 1993, one-in-ten adults thought that the chances were “excellent” that we would elect a black American as president, 44% thought the chances were “good,” 24% thought they were “not good” and 21% thought they were “poor.”
