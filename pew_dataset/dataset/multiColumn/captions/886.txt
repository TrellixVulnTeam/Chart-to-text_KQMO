Democrats are more likely than Republicans to see the coronavirus in the most serious terms. As of last week, nearly eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners (78%) say the outbreak is a major threat to the health of the U.S. population as a whole; a much smaller share of Republicans and GOP leaners (52%) say the same. Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to say the coronavirus outbreak presents a major threat to the U.S. economy, their personal finances and their own health.
