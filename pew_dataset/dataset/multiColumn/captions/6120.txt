In 2011, 3 million recent movers who were previously homeowners became renters, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the Census Bureauâ€™s American Housing Survey data. This is substantially greater than the flow into renter status observed in 2001, when 2.56 million prior homeowners became renters.
