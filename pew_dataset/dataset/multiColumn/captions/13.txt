An estimated 464,000 Hispanics of Nicaraguan origin resided in the United States in 2017, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Nicaraguans in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Nicaraguan origin; this includes immigrants from Nicaragua and those who trace their family ancestry to Nicaragua.
Nicaraguans are the 12th-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States, accounting for less than 1% of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017. Since 2000, the Nicaraguan-origin population has increased 128%, growing from 203,000 to 464,000 over the period. At the same time, the Nicaraguan foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew by 63%, up from 156,000 in 2000 to 255,000 in 2017. By comparison, Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, constituted 36.6 million, or 62%, of the Hispanic population in 2017.
