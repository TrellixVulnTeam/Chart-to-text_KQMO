Currently, 49% of Americans say it is more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns, while 46% say it is more important to control gun ownership. In September 2010, 50% prioritized gun control, 46% gun rights. In this regard, there is no sign that the longer trend toward an emphasis on gun owners’ rights has abated.
The issue remains a deeply divisive one along party lines — by a 72%-to-22% margin Republicans say protecting gun rights is more important, while by a 70%-to-26% margin Democrats prioritize gun control. Independents are more divided, with 52% favoring gun rights and 44% gun control.
