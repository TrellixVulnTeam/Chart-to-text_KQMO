Large gaps persist between blacks and whites on measures of wealth and income. Among blacks, the median household income was $44,100 in 2015, compared with $75,100 for whites. And among full- and part-time workers, the median hourly earnings of blacks were 75% of whites in 2015. In terms of wealth, the median net worth of white households was roughly 13 times that of black households in 2013 ($144,200 for white households, $11,200 for black households).
The poverty rate among blacks is the highest among major racial and ethnic groups, but it has declined over time, from 31.1% in 1976 to 24.1% in 2015, according to Census Bureau data. By comparison, the overall U.S. poverty rate has increased from 11.8% in 1976 to 13.5% in 2015.
