This discontinuity between American views of globalization and the sentiments of most people around the world is also evident in public perspectives on the impact of trade. In developing economies, a median of 66% say trade increases jobs and 55% say it grows wages. In emerging markets, 52% say global business ties create jobs and 45% hold the view that it improves wages. Americans, on the other hand, are among the least likely to say trade creates jobs (20%) or improves wages (17%), exhibiting notably less faith in the benefits of trade than others in advanced economies.
