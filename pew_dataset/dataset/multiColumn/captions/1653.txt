The share of Indonesians who hold favorable views of China has declined over time amid concerns over increasing economic dependence on Beijing. In 2018, 53% had a favorable view of China, down from 66% in 2014, the year of the last Indonesian election.
Confidence in the Chinese president to do the right thing regarding world affairs has remained relatively stable over time, with only 36% of Indonesian adults expressing confidence in the current leader, Xi Jinping, and a similar share expressing confidence in President Hu Jintao in 2011. However, in both 2011 and 2018, roughly three-in-ten (31% in both years) offered no response.
