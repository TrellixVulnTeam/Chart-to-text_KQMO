While younger teens – 16- and 17-year-olds – are still less likely to work in the summer than their older peers, their overall employment level has increased a bit faster in the post-recession period. Last year’s summer employment rate for 16- and 17-year-olds was 24.1%, up from 18.5% in 2010. For 18- and 19-year-olds, the summer employment rate last year was 46.2%, compared with 41.6% in 2010.
