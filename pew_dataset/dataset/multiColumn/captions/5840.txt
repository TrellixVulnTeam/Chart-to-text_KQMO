The July 2011 survey found that the debt ceiling debate had “tarnished the image of both President Obama and Speaker (John) Boehner,” with about a third saying they had formed a less favorable view of the pair in the preceding weeks. When it came to the parties in Congress, 42% said their impression of Republicans had become less favorable as a result of the negotiations, compared with 30% who said that of the Democrats.
