Negative views of China predominate in both the United States and Canada, where 60% and 67% respectively see the country unfavorably. In both countries, this is the highest unfavorable opinion of China recorded in the Center’s polling history. (For more on U.S. opinion, see “U.S. Views of China Turn Sharply Negative Amid Trade Tensions.”) It also reflects the largest year-on-year change in either country. For example, in Canada, unfavorable opinion increased 22 points in the wake of the high-profile arrest of technology company Huawei’s chief financial officer and the ensuing Chinese detainment of two Canadian nationals who still remain in Chinese custody.
