In our survey, LGBT adults said pride events are important to making society more accepting, but not as important as some other things, such as people knowing someone who is LGBT and well known public figures who are LGBT or who support LGBT rights. Still, about three-quarters of LGBT adults think LGBT pride events help make society at least a little more accepting of the LGBT population, with about three-in-ten LGBT adults (28%) saying LGBT pride events help “a lot” with social acceptance and about five-in-ten (48%) saying these events help “a little.”
Within the LGBT community, views on the importance of LGBT pride events vary. While about three-in-ten gay men, lesbians and bisexual women think these events help advance social acceptance of LGBT Americans “a lot,” only 12% of bisexual men say the same.
