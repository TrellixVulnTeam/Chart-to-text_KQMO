In 1960, about a fifth of the U.S. population were first- or second-generation immigrants. If present trends continue, by 2050 about 37% of the population will be first- or second-generation immigrants â€“ an even higher share than during the vast influx of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe in the late 1800s/early 1900s.
