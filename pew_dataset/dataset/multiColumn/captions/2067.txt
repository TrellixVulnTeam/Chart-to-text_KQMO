Unlike in 2014, when 2.1 million more votes were cast in Republican than in Democratic House primaries, this year Democratic races drew more votes: 20.4 million versus 16.3 million. That was nearly twice as many votes as the 10.7 million cast in 2014â€™s Democratic House primaries. One reason: There have been a lot more contested primaries on the Democratic side this year, and contested races tend to attract more voters.
