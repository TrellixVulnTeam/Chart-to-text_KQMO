As Obama nears the end of his presidency, his overall approval rating has steadily risen over the last year. Today, 58% say they approve of how he’s handling his job, while 37% disapprove. More now approve of Obama’s job performance than at any point since shortly after he was re-elected in 2012.
Today, nearly nine-in-ten Democrats (88%) say they approve of the job Obama is doing as president, while just 15% of Republicans say the same. A 58% majority of independents say they approve of the way Obama is handling his job, up six points from October and 16 points from a year ago.
