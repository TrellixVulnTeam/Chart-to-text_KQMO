Russians’ views toward the U.S. briefly improved after the election of Donald Trump, but they have fallen to levels last seen near the end of the Obama administration. Only 26% of Russians now have a favorable view of the U.S., down from 41% in 2017. Among Americans, just 21% see Russia favorably, similar to the share who had a favorable view after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea (19%).
