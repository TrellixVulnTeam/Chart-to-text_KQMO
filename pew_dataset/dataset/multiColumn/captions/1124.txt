Same-sex marriage has the backing of a majority of U.S. adults. Same-sex marriage is another policy area where support surpassed opposition during the 2010s. As of this year, 61% of Americans favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally. In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its landmark Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, which established that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry.
