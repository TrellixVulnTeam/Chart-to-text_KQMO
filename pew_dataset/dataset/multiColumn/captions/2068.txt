Women account for more than a quarter (28%) of the 67 judges President Donald Trump has successfully appointed to the federal courts since taking office. That’s well below the share appointed by Barack Obama – whose 324 judicial appointees were a record 42% female – but higher than the share appointed by any other Republican president, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the Federal Judicial Center.
In both parties, presidents have appointed a growing share of female judges in recent decades. Women represented 22% of the 324 judges appointed by Republican George W. Bush during his eight years in office, 19% of the 188 judges appointed by George H.W. Bush and 8% of the 364 judges appointed by Ronald Reagan. Among recent Democratic presidents, Obama’s total exceeded the share appointed by Bill Clinton (28% of 372 judges) and Jimmy Carter (16% of 261 judges). Trump’s numbers are as of Sept. 30 and will change as the Senate moves to confirm more of his pending judicial nominees and as he identifies new nominees for vacant positions.
