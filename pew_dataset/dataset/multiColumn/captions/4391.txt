Asia-Pacific publics have more mixed views about each other’s leaders, in part due to their lack of familiarity with them. A median of 47% have confidence in Chinese President Xi Jinping to do the right thing regarding world affairs. A median of 43% have confidence in Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s handling of international issues, with more than twice as many expressing support. But just 39% voice confidence in Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s role on the world stage. The share with positive sentiment about Modi is again larger than those with negative views, but a relatively high proportion of respondents voice no opinion, a testimony to Modi’s low public profile in the region.
