About six-in-ten (62%) online adults have heard of The Colbert Report, and 10% get news there.
More people have heard of the Comedy Central show than many other news sources, including NPR (53%), The Economist (34%) and BuzzFeed (31%). But The Colbert Report is not as well-known as top cable news channels, broadcast television networks and major national newspapers. Although its audience is not as large as major TV networks, the show attracts a following similar to some national newspapers: One-in-ten (10%) online adults said they got news from the show in the previous week, on par with such sources as the Wall Street Journal and USA Today.
Younger males are the most likely to use and trust The Colbert Report as a source of news about government and politics.
In our recent survey of online adults, nearly a quarter (22%) of 18- to 29- year-old males say they got news about politics and government from The Colbert Report in the previous week. That is more than twice that of 18- to 29- year-old women and significantly higher than any other age group. Also, these younger males are more likely to trust The Colbert Report as a source of political news; almost three-in-ten say that they trust it, more than any other age group.
