While the overall share who are angry is unchanged, Republicans and Democrats have moved in opposite directions since 2015. A year before the 2016 presidential election, one-third of Republicans said they were angry with the government, compared with about one-in-ten Democrats (11%). About a year after Trumpâ€™s inauguration, the share of Republicans saying they were angry had declined to 19%, while the share of Democrats saying this had increased to 29%. Today, about one-third of Democrats (34%) say they are angry, compared with just 14% of Republicans.
