Public views of Republican leaders’ policies, which were nearly two-to-one positive in the month after the election (52% approve, 28% disapprove), turned negative just eight months later. In August 1995, 38% approved GOP leaders’ proposals while 45% disapproved. Notably, these opinions did not change much over the following year – including through the period of the two government shutdowns.
