Meanwhile, fewer Democrats say the news media are treating either candidate fairly than in past years. While eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners said the news media were fair in their coverage of Obama in 2008, this figure dropped to 62% in 2012, and is now about half (48%) for Clinton. Similarly, their share for the Republican candidate fell from 67% in 2008 to 40% this year.
