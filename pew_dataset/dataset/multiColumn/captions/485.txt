Even as Americans hold mixed views about the importance of such statements, they have become fairly common following the global protests that erupted in response to the killing of Floyd in police custody on Memorial Day. This survey finds that a vast majority of adults (80%) say they have seen or heard companies and organizations making public statements about race or racial inequality in the past few months, with majorities across racial and ethnic groups and political parties saying this.
Majorities across racial and ethnic groups think pressure from others has contributed a great deal to these statements. But white adults who have come across recent statements from firms about race or racial inequality are more likely to express this sentiment â€“ with 73% saying this compared with about six-in-ten of the same group of Black, Hispanic or Asian adults. On the other hand, Hispanic (31%) and Black (30%) Americans are about twice as likely as Asian (16%) or white Americans (14%) to believe genuine concerns for Black people motivated companies a great deal to make statements about race or racial inequality.
