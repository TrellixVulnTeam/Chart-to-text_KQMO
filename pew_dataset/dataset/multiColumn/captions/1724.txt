A majority of U.S. adults trust medical scientists a lot for information about vaccines. Some 55% of Americans said in 2016 that they trust medical scientists a lot to give full and accurate information about the health risks and benefits of the childhood MMR vaccine. Another 35% said they have some trust in medical scientists, while just 9% said they trust them not too much or not at all. High degrees of trust in other groups were much lower, however. For example, no more than one-in-ten Americans placed a lot of trust in elected officials (6%) and news media (8%) to provide accurate information about the MMR vaccine.
