Many Germans see the U.S. as a top foreign policy partner; fewer Americans feel the same way about Germany. When asked which countries are their most important partners in global affairs, Germans name France more than any other country, but the U.S. is in the second spot. More than four-in-ten Germans say the U.S. is either their country’s first or second most important partner. Americans are much less likely to see Germany this way: Only 12% name Germany as one of America’s top two partners. Still, Germany does make the top four, trailing Great Britain and China and tying with Israel.
