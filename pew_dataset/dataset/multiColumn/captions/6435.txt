The survey finds that public’s most closely followed story, for the second week in a row, is news about the child sex abuse scandal at Penn State University (27% most closely); 15% tracked news about the economy most closely and 13% cited news about the presidential candidates as their top story. Just 3% say they followed news about the super committee most closely.
The deficit panel also drew relatively little news coverage, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism. News about the super committee accounted for 4% of all coverage last week, much less than the Penn State scandal (15%), the 2012 elections (12%) or the Occupy Wall Street protests (13%).
