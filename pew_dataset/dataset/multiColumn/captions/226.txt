Around three-quarters of Americans (77%) say it is not very or not at all acceptable for social media companies to leverage usersâ€™ data to show them ads from political campaigns. A much smaller share of adults (22%) say this practice is very or somewhat acceptable, according to the September survey. Partisans agree about the unacceptability of this practice, with 78% of Republicans and 76% of Democrats saying it is not very or not at all acceptable.
