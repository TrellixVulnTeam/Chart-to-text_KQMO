As it turns out, there are early hints that congressional productivity may be on an upswing, after two successive Congresses that enacted the fewest- and second-fewest laws in at least four decades. According to the Library of Congress’ THOMAS database, Congress passed 49 measures before its summer break (though some of them weren’t formally signed into law by President Obama until afterward). We categorize 35 of those acts as “substantive” by our deliberately generous criteria – that is, any legislation other than renaming buildings, giving out medals, commemorating historic events and other purely ceremonial acts.
By contrast, the 112th Congress had passed just 28 pieces of legislation – 19 of them substantive – by the time its August 2011 recess rolled around, matching the level of the 104th Congress in 1995. The 113th Congress was slightly more productive, passing 31 laws (24 of them substantive) by its first August recess, which is formally known as a district (or state) work period.
Lawmakers don’t always get off to such a slow start. In 2007, Congress had passed 81 laws (though 35 of them were ceremonial); four years earlier, 79 laws had been passed by the time Congress went on its August break. But early-session activity doesn’t always indicate how productive a Congress will be over its entire two-year term: The 106th Congress, which passed 580 laws during its 1999-2000 term, had passed just 56 by its August 1999 recess.
