Almost one-in-five voting members of the House and Senate are a racial or ethnic minority, making the 115th U.S. Congress the most diverse in history. And while Congress as a whole remains disproportionately white when compared with the U.S. population, the racial and ethnic profile of newly elected members more closely resembles the increasingly diverse populace, according to a Pew Research Center analysis.
Among minority groups in Congress, the biggest growth over time has been among Hispanics and Asians, both of whom have doubled their representation in the national legislature since 2001. Today, there are 39 Hispanics and 15 Asians in office, up from 19 Hispanics and seven Asians in the 107th Congress.
