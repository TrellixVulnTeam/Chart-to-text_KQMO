And the Republican Party fares much better on issues than image. Despite the majority view that the GOP lacks empathy for the middle class, about as many Americans say the Republican Party (44%) as the Democratic Party (41%) can do better in dealing with the economy. On immigration the public also is divided: 45% say the Democrats can do better, while 43% prefer the GOP. The only issue on which Democrats have an edge is on health care (47% to 40%).
Views of the party best able to handle foreign policy have taken a particular turn in favor of the Republican Party: Today 48% say the GOP would do a better job on this issue, while 35% say the Democratic Party. This is the first time during the Obama administration that the GOP has held the edge on foreign policy.
