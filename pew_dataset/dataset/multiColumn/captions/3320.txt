Based on the conventional statistics used to gauge educational attainment, the nation has made some progress toward this 2020 goal during the Obama years. In March 2009, 41% of 25- to 34-year-olds had completed at least an associate degree. By March 2016, 48% of young adults had done so.
Women continue to outpace men in terms of educational attainment, though both groups are making gains at a fairly similar rate. A larger share of female 25- to 34-year-olds (52%) had finished college in 2016 than their male counterparts (43%).
