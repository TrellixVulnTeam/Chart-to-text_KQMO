A new survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted Feb. 5-8 among 1,003 adults, shows that views of news about the overall economy also have become more positive, although a majority (62%) continues to describe the news as mixed. For the first time since the Pew Research Center began tracking this question in December 2008, about as many are hearing mostly good news (18%) as bad news (17%) about the economy. In previous surveys, negative views had consistently surpassed positive impressions.
Views about economic news – like news about the job situation – have improved dramatically in the last 12 months. In February 2014, one-third (33%) were hearing mostly bad news and just 5% were hearing mostly good economic news. Today, the share hearing bad news has dropped 16 points and good news has risen 13 points. About six-in-ten today (62%) are still hearing mixed news.
