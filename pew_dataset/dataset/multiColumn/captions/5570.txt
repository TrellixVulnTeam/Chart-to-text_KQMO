There were also partisan disagreements over what kind of impact would come from granting legal status to millions of unauthorized immigrants who entered the country illegally. About three-in-four Republicans thought that doing so would encourage more people to come to the U.S. illegally and that it would be a drain on government services; about half of Democrats agreed. A greater share of Republicans also believed that legal status for those who live here illegally would reward such behavior and take jobs from U.S. citizens. But a substantial majority of both parties said that deporting all unauthorized immigrants would be unrealistic and that it would be better for the economy if they became legal workers.
