Amid increased concern about global climate change, most U.S. adults prioritize developing alternative energy sources for the country such as solar or wind power rather than increasing U.S. exploration and production of fossil fuels (77% vs. 22%). The same Pew Research Center survey finds a growing share of homeowners are considering solar panels for home use.
Just 6% of U.S. homeowners say they have already installed solar panels at home. Another 46% say they have given serious thought to adding solar panels at their home in the past year. The share of homeowners considering getting solar panels is up from 40% in 2016 and has especially increased among those living in the South Atlantic states ranging from Delaware to Florida.
About half of homeowners in the South Atlantic states (51%) say they are considering installing solar panels, up 20 percentage points from 2016. Homeowners in other Southern states (the East and West South Central region) tend to express more interest in installing solar panels (45% in 2019 compared with 34% in 2016), though this 11 percentage point difference is not statistically significant. Just 3% of Southern homeowners say they have solar panels at their residence, a similar share as in 2016.
