Public trust in Putin has remained low in Western Europe over the past decade. Poles have shown even lower confidence in Putin, with no more than about one-in-five expressing confidence at any point over the past 10 years.
Over the same period, Americansâ€™ confidence in Putin has eroded somewhat, from 30% in 2007 to 21% today. After differing by 11 percentage points in 2012, American and Western European views of Putin have tracked more closely in recent years.
