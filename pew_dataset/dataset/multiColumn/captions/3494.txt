Republicans and Democrats have grown increasingly negative in their evaluations of presidents representing the other party. Partisan divisions over presidential performance are wider now than at any point going back more than six decades, and this growing gap is largely the result of increasing disapproval of the chief executive from the opposition party. An average of just 14% of Republicans have approved of Barack Obama over the course of his presidency, compared with an average of 81% of Democrats.
