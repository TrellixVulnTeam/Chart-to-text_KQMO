Today, 76% of the public says that prescription drug abuse is an extremely or very serious public health problem in America, compared with 63% who said the same in 2013. Just 22% regard prescription drug abuse as a somewhat serious or less serious problem, down from 34% in 2013.
Concerns about mental illness are also up slightly from 2013. Currently, 72% say mental illness is an extremely or very serious public health problem, compared with 67% who said this four years ago, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Oct. 25-30 among 1,504 adults.
Other public health concerns are largely unchanged since 2013. Eight-in-ten Americans now say cancer is an extremely or very serious problem, while 71% say the same for obesity; similar shares said this in 2013. The shares today saying that alcohol abuse (52%), smoking (51%) and AIDS (47%) are at least very serious public health concerns are little changed from four years ago and remain lower than other problems asked about.
