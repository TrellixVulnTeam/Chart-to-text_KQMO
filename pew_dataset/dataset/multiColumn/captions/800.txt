For example, about two-thirds (68%) of Republicans who live in states where about a third or more of voters cast their ballots by mail say they favor allowing any voter to cast their ballot by mail if they want to. This compares with roughly four-in-ten of those who live in states with low rates of voting by mail.
There is less variation in views among Democrats. More than eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners – regardless of their state’s rate of 2018 mail voting – say they favor allowing any voter to vote by mail if they want to. However, Democrats in states with higher or more moderate rates of mail-in voting in 2018 are slightly more likely to say they strongly support allowing any voter to vote by mail than those in states where fewer vote by mail.
