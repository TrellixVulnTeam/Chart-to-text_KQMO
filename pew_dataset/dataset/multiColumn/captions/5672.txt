Between 2006-2008 and 2011-2012, confidence in government fell by at least six percentage points in 18 of the 34 member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to Gallup data compiled in a new report, “Government at a Glance 2o13.” The steepest drop was in Ireland, where the share of people answering “yes” to the question “In this country, do you have confidence in each of the following, or not? How about national government?” tumbled from 63% in 2006 to 35% six years later.
On average, just 40% of people in OECD countries said they had confidence in their national governments, down from an average of 45% in 2007. Confidence levels ranged from 77% in Switzerland to 13% in Greece; in the U.S., confidence was 35%.
Public confidence in government was higher in the so-called BRIICS countries — Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa — averaging 54%, about the same as in 2007 (though there was no earlier reading for China). That was despite a 27-percentage-point fall in government confidence in India, from 82% to 55%.
