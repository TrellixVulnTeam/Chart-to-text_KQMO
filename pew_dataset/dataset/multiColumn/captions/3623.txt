Americans are also less accepting of implanted devices that would result in more dramatic rather than modest changes in the recipient. For example, the public is closely divided over whether an implanted device that improves a person’s mental functioning to a level equal to their current peak abilities would be appropriate or taking technology too far. By a ratio of more than two-to-one, people are much more likely to say that implanting devices that dramatically increase a person’s peak abilities would be taking technology too far.
