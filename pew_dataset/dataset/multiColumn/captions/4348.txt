An estimated 381,000 Hispanics of Nicaraguan origin resided in the United States in 2013, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.
Nicaraguans in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Nicaraguan origin; this means either they themselves are Nicaraguan immigrants or they trace their family ancestry to Nicaragua.
Nicaraguans are the 12th-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States, accounting for 0.7% of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2013. Since 1990, the Nicaraguan-origin population nearly doubled, growing from 203,000 to 381,000 over the period. At the same time, the foreign-born population of Nicaraguan origin living in the U.S. grew by 35%, up from 164,000 in 1990 to 222,000 in 2013. In comparison, Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, constituted 34.6 million, or 64.1%, of the Hispanic population in 2013.
