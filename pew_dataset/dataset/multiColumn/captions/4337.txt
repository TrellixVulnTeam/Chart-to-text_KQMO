Although there is a pervasive gloominess about the state of the economy throughout much of the world, Africans are relatively positive about their short- and long-term economic future. Across the nine African nations polled, a median of 60% say they expect their country’s economy to improve over the next 12 months, the highest of any region. A median of 56% believe children in their country today will be financially better off than their parents, and about seven-in-ten or more hold this view in Nigeria, Ethiopia and Burkina Faso.
Africans continue to say their countries face a variety of challenges. Despite the optimism about the economic future, people still have many economic concerns – for instance, a median of 88% say the lack of employment opportunities is a very big problem. And when asked about six potential areas for improvement, beyond strictly economic issues, many identify health care and education as top priorities. Health care is the top choice in eight of nine countries, while education tops the list in South Africa.
