The fact that religion is generally less central to the lives of Israeli Muslims is also borne out by the relatively low rates of salat (five daily prayers), alms-giving and fasting during Ramadan. Together, these practices represent three of the Five Pillars of Islam — rituals all Muslims are expected to observe.
Roughly half (52%) of Israeli Muslims pray five times a day, compared with a median of 63% among Muslims in other Middle Eastern and North African countries polled, including 83% in Iraq. Jordan and Egypt are the only countries polled where the proportion of Muslims who pray all five times stands at roughly half – 54% and 53% respectively.
Similarly, while a majority of Israeli Muslims give a portion of their accumulated wealth to charities or the needy (a practice known as zakat), this is a significantly smaller proportion than is found among Muslims elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa. A regional median of 79% of Muslims practice zakat, with rates of observance as high as nine-in-ten in Morocco (92%).
In the case of fasting during Ramadan, Israel’s Muslims also tend to be less observant. While 83% of Israeli Muslims do observe the ritual fast from dawn until dusk, this is a significantly smaller percentage than in Muslim-majority countries such as Morocco (98%) and Tunisia (96%). A median of 94% across the Middle East and North Africa say they fast during Ramadan.
