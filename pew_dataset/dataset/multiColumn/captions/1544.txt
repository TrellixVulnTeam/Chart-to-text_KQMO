The survey finds that majorities of Democrats generally say the gender, race or sexuality of the Democratic nominee wouldn’t make a difference in their enthusiasm for the candidate. About two-thirds or more say having a woman nominee (64%), a black nominee (75%) or a gay, lesbian or bisexual nominee (68%) wouldn’t make a difference.
Still, far more Democrats say they would be more enthusiastic (31%) than less enthusiastic (4%) if the party’s nominee were a woman. Larger shares also say they would be more enthusiastic than less enthusiastic if the nominee were black (21% vs. 4%), Hispanic (21% vs. 6%) or Asian (16% vs. 9%).
