Most Americans say the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak has been less effective than that of other wealthy nations. Around six-in-ten adults (62%) hold that view, while a quarter say Americaâ€™s response has been about as effective and 13% say it has been more effective, according to a survey conducted July 27 to Aug. 2.
Attitudes on this question are deeply divided along partisan lines, as they are on many questions related to the coronavirus. Almost nine-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (87%) say the U.S. response has been less effective than that of other wealthy countries, while Republicans and GOP leaners are much more divided: Around a third (34%) say it has been less effective, 42% say it has been about as effective and 22% say it has been more effective.
