This lack of adherence to best practices begins with the ways that Americans keep track of the passwords to their online accounts. Cybersecurity experts generally recommend password management software as the safest and most secure way to track and maintain online passwords.
Still, just 12% of internet users say that they ever use password management software themselves – and only 3% say that this is the password technique they rely on most. Instead, roughly two-thirds (65%) of internet users say that memorization is the main or only way they keep track of their online passwords – and another 18% rely primarily on writing their passwords down on a piece of paper. In other words, fully 84% of online adults rely primarily on memorization or pen and paper as their main (or only) approach to password management.
