Their positive take on the U.S. does not keep the Japanese from taking a pessimistic view of their long-time allyâ€™s trajectory on the world stage. About six-in-ten (61%) say the United States plays a less important and powerful role as a world leader today compared with 10 years ago. Just 7% believe the U.S. plays a more important role, while 29% say Washington is as important as a decade ago. Such Japanese sentiment about a longtime ally is striking: Only 39% of the Chinese see the U.S. as less important than before.
