Nearly half of Americans (47%) say their greater concern about government anti-terrorism policies is that they have gone too far in restricting the average personâ€™s civil liberties; 35% say their greater concern is that they have not gone far enough to adequately protect the country. There has been a 15-point rise in the percentage saying their greater concern is civil liberties since Pew Research last asked the question in October 2010. This is the first time a plurality has expressed greater concern about civil liberties than security since the question was first asked in 2004.
