A Pew Research Center analysis of government data published earlier this month found that 36% of the nation’s young adults ages 18 to 31 — the so-called Millennial generation — were living in their parents’ home in 2012. This was the highest share in at least four decades and represented a slow but steady increase over the 32% of their same-aged counterparts who were living at home prior to the Great Recession in 2007.
The growing gender parity in likelihood of residing at home is especially pronounced among 18- to 24-year-olds: 60% of men and 52% of women in that age group lived at home in 2012, an 8-percentage-point gap. In 1968, 59% of male 18- to 24-year-olds, but only 42% of females lived at home: a difference of 17 percentage points.
