For the month of August, public interest in the 2012 campaign is on par with the summer of 2008. On average, over the past four weeks 29% of Americans say they have followed news about the presidential candidates very closely; 28% said the same in August of 2008. This is the fifth consecutive month in which 2012 campaign interest has been equal to interest in the 2008 campaign cycle.
In previous elections, public attention to campaign news has spiked in September, following the final party conventions. In 2008, the share following the election very closely jumped from 28% in August to 47% in September.
