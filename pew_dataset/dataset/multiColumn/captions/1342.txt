Millennials are now the largest generation in the U.S. labor force. Roughly a third of Americans in the labor force (35%, or 56 million) are Millennials – those ages 23 to 38 in 2019. In 2016, Millennials surpassed Generation Xers (ages 39 to 54 in 2019) to become the single largest generational group in the U.S. labor force. Compared with Baby Boomers, Gen Xers’ place as the dominant generation within the labor force was very short-lived – just three years.
