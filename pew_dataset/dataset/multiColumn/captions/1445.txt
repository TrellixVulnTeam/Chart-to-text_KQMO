On this scale, the share of whites who show high levels of trust (27%) is twice as high as the share of black (13%) and Hispanic adults (12%). The older a person is, the more likely they are to tilt toward more trustful answers. The more education Americans have, and the greater their household income, the greater the likelihood they are high on the personal trust spectrum. Those with less income and education are markedly more likely to be low trusters. Strikingly, nearly half of young adults (46%) are in the low trust group â€“ a significantly higher share than among older adults.
