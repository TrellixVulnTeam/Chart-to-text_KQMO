A majority of the public believes much of their online activities are being tracked. More Americans say they think that what they do online or on their cellphone is being tracked than believe their offline activities are tracked. They are also more likely to believe companies track more of their activities (both online and off) than think that the government is collecting information on them. For example, the majority of Americans believe that all or most of what they do online and on their cellphone is being tracked by companies (72%), while just 47% think the same of the government. Smaller shares believe all or most of their offline activities (like where they go and who they talk to) are being tracked by companies (31%) and the government (24%).
