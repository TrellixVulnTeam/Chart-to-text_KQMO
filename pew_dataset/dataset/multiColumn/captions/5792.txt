Hard times can act to bring families together, and the Great Recession of 2007-09 was no different: The number of children living with a grandparent surged after the onset of the recession, as did the number of children whose primary caregiver was that grandparent.
A Pew Research Center analysis of Census data found that 7.7 million U.S. children — about 10% of all children in the country — were living in the same household as at least one of their grandparents in 2011, and for 3 million that grandparent also was their primary caregiver. Both trends stabilized at higher level after the recession’s official end in mid-2009.
