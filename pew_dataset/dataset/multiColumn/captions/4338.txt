Africans continue to say their countries face a variety of challenges. Despite the optimism about the economic future, people still have many economic concerns â€“ for instance, a median of 88% say the lack of employment opportunities is a very big problem. And when asked about six potential areas for improvement, beyond strictly economic issues, many identify health care and education as top priorities. Health care is the top choice in eight of nine countries, while education tops the list in South Africa.
In addition to domestic concerns, many in the region also are worried about global challenges, especially climate change. A median of 59% say they are very concerned about global climate change. Among the seven global threats tested on the survey, climate change tops the list in seven of the nine African nations polled. Only Latin Americans express a similar level of concern about this issue.
