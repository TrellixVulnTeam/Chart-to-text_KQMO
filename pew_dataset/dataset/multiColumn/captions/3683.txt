Regional growth patterns have changed some following the start of the Great Recession. While counties in the South continued to account for the largest share of the nation’s Hispanic population growth (43% between 2007 and 2014, a small decline from 44% between 2000 and 2007), counties in the Northeast – particularly those in New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania – accounted for a larger share of national Hispanic population growth since 2007 than in 2000-2007 (14% vs. 11%, respectively). 2 There was a small decline for all of the other regions of the U.S. during these periods.
