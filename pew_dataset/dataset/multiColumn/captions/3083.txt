Today, Republicans (21%) and Democrats (24%) are about equally likely to express anger about the federal government. This reflects substantial shifts within both parties over the last year: Levels of anger toward the federal government have fallen sharply among Republicans, while levels among Democrats are up significantly.
Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents the share feeling angry toward the federal government is down 12 percentage points from March 2016 (from 33% to 21%). The last time anger toward government was about this low among Republicans was in March 2011 (18%), shortly after Republicans regained control of Congress following victories in the 2010 midterm elections. Still, Republicans are more likely to express anger at government today than they were during the Bush administration.
By contrast, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are about twice as likely to express anger toward the federal government than they were a year ago (11% then, 24% today). The only time during the Obama administration that levels of Democratic anger were about as high as they are now was in October 2013, during the federal government shutdown, when 25% said they were angry. Democratic anger at government was at similar levels during Bushâ€™s second term.
