The rise in approval of GOP leaders is largely attributable to a turnaround among Republicans: 68% approve of GOP leaders’ performance now; only 26% did so two years ago.
For most of the past six years Republicans have given GOP leaders in Congress relatively low approval ratings. Republicans have controlled the House since 2010 and took control of the Senate in 2014.
In September 2015, a tumultuous period during which former House Speaker John Boehner resigned, just 26% of Republicans and Republican leaners approved of the job GOP leaders were doing. Today, with Republicans in full control of Congress, as well as the White House, 68% of Republicans and Republican leaners approve of their job performance.
Democrats’ views of their party’s leaders have shown less change over this period. Currently, 58% of Democrats and Democratic leaners approve of their job performance. In September 2015, 59% of Democrats gave the party’s leaders positive approval ratings.
