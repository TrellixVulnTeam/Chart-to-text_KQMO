Since 2013, deficit reduction has fallen as a top priority among both Republicans and Democrats. Today, 54% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents and 44% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say reducing the deficit should be a top priority for President Donald Trump and Congress.
Six years ago, about eight-in-ten Republicans (81%) said reducing the deficit should be a top priority and about two-thirds of Democrats (65%) agreed.
