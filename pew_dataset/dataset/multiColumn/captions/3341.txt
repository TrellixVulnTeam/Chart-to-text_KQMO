On the broader question of overall race relations in American society, the overwhelming majority (92%) of white officers say the U.S. has made the changes needed to give blacks equal rights with whites; just 29% of black officers agree. The general public is divided along racial lines on this question, too, but not as much as police officers: About six-in-ten whites (57%) say the country has made the changes needed to bring about equal rights for blacks, compared with just 12% of blacks.
