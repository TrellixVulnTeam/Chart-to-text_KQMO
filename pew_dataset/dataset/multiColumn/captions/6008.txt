At the start of his presidency, Obama received significantly more positive ratings than his predecessor. In 2009, Egyptians were almost evenly divided between those who expressed confidence that Obama would “do the right thing” in world affairs (42%) and those who lacked confidence in the new American president (47%).
But Obama’s ratings have steadily declined, and today, only 26% of Egyptians express confidence in him, while 72% have little or no confidence.
