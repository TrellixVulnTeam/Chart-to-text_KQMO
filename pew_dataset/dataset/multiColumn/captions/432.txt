Voters find the debates useful, but not determinative. Post-election surveys conducted by Pew Research Center since 1988 have found that, in most cases, three-fifths or more of voters say the debates were very or somewhat helpful in deciding which candidate to vote for. The high point was 1992, when 70% of voters said the three three-way debates that year between Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ross Perot were at least somewhat helpful.
