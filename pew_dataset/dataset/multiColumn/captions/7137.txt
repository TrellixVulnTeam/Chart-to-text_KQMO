The economy, meanwhile, continues to dominate both public interest and news coverage. Three-in-ten say they followed reports about the economy more closely than any other story last week. Another 17% say they followed reports on Obama’s budget proposal most closely and 8% say they followed administration plans to expand federal regulation of financial institutions most closely. Stories about the economy – including Obama’s budget proposal – filled up 41% of the media newshole, according to the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism.
With Obama’s historic campaign dominating media coverage in the run up to the Nov. 4 election, the public at times seemed to think the Democratic candidate was overexposed. In early August, about two-thirds of Republicans (67%) said they were hearing too much about Obama, compared with 51% of independents and 34% of Democrats.
