Only about a third of blacks say race relations in the U.S. are good. About six-in-ten blacks (61%) say race relations in the U.S. are generally bad, while just 34% say relations are generally good. Whites are more split on the state of race relations in the country, with nearly equal shares saying relations are good (46%) as say they are bad (45%). About nine-in-ten (88%) blacks say the country needs to continue making changes to give blacks equal rights with whites, compared with 53% of whites. Immediately following the election of President Donald Trump, a far greater share of blacks (74%) than whites (43%) said they expected the election would lead to worse race relations.
