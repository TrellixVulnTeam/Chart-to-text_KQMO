Overall, Americans believe there should be a strong connection between local journalists and the communities they serve. But there are again some partisan differences on several measures of that connection. Republicans, for example, are somewhat less likely than Democrats to say local journalists are in touch with the communities they serve (61% of Republicans say this vs. 67% of Democrats) and that local news media cover the area where they live (49% vs. 54%) and have a lot of local influence (34% vs. 40%).
