The U.S. is by far Canada’s largest trading partner, accounting for $707 billion in goods and private services trade between the two countries in 2012. When asked whether it is more important to have strong economic ties with China or the U.S., 73% of Canadians choose the U.S. Only 13% would favor stronger economic ties with China.
Despite these sentiments, Canadians tend to believe that China, and not the U.S., is the world’s leading economic power. A 46% plurality of Canadians say that China is the top economy, while just 34% name the U.S. French-speaking Canadians (58%) and followers of the NDP (57%) are more likely to name China as the world’s leading economy, compared with English speakers (43%) and both Liberals (44%) and CPC supporters (40%).
