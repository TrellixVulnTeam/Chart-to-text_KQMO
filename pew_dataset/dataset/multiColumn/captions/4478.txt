Consistent Support for U.S. Military Action. About six-in-ten Americans (63%) approve of the U.S. military campaign against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria; just 26% disapprove of the campaign. Support is somewhat higher today than for President Obamaâ€™s first airstrikes against Islamic militants in Iraq in August 2014 (54% approved).
