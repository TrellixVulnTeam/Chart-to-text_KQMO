The months-long BP story was one of the two biggest stories of the year in terms of news interest. In the week ending July 25, 2010 – shortly after BP said it had capped the leak and just before the resignation of CEO Tony Hayward – fully 59% of American adults were following the Gulf leak very closely. The only story as closely watched in 2010 was that of another disaster, the January earthquake in Haiti (60% paid close attention at the peak).
Public interest went hand-in-hand with the vast amount of news coverage of the spill. The Gulf spill was the most covered news story in nine weeks out of a 14-week period studied by Pew Research Center. Our study of media coverage from April 20 to July 28, 2010, showed that the spill accounted for 22% of the newshole (almost double the next-biggest story) and generated 31% of cable news airtime. Public interest in the news remained high, even in weeks when news coverage dropped off; in 13 of those 14 weeks, the public followed the story of the spill more closely than any other.
