UPDATE, 12:58 p.m. The new Millennials report from Pew Research shows strong support across generations for maintaining Social Security benefits at current levels (even though half of Millennials and Gen-Xers say they don’t expect to receive any Social Security benefits when they retire). Debra Whitman of AARP says her group’s research has found that younger generations (Boomers and Gen-Xers) support Social Security because, with the erosion of defined-benefit pensions and 401(k)s whipsawed by the stock market, they’re counting on it more.
