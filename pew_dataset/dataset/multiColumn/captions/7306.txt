Obama was by far the most visible candidate in the news last week. Two-thirds of the public (67%) named Obama as the candidate theyâ€™ve been hearing the most about in the news in the past week or so. Roughly one-in-five (22%) named Clinton and just 2% named McCain. While Obama has remained the most visible candidate for 13 straight weeks, he has not dominated Clinton and McCain to this extent since mid-March when he gave his speech on race and politics.
