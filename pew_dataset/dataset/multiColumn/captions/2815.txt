Republicans have recently turned negative in their assessments of the impact of colleges and universities, and a new survey finds that they also have a skeptical view of college professors. More Republicans offer a cold than warm view of professors on a “feeling thermometer” scale ranging from 0 to 100, with an average rating of 46.
The Pew Research Center survey, conducted on the American Trends Panel in August, asks the public to rate a number of groups on a “feeling thermometer” from 0 to 100, where 0 is the coldest, most negative rating and 100 is the warmest, most positive. Overall, about half of the public (49%) gives college professors at least a somewhat warm rating, including a third (33%) who rate professors very warmly. Fewer (24%) give professors a cold rating, while 26% have a neutral view of professors.
Democrats have a broadly positive view of college professors. About two-thirds (66%) give professors a warm rating, while just 7% offer a cold rating and 24% express a neutral view. Liberal Democrats are more likely than conservative and moderate Democrats to rate professors warmly, though majorities of both groups do so (76% and 56%, respectively).
Views among Republicans are much chillier: 43% give cold ratings to college professors, including about a quarter (27%) who give a very cold rating. A significantly smaller share of Republicans (30%) give professors a warm rating, while 25% take a neutral view. Conservative Republicans are especially likely to give very (31%) or somewhat (20%) cold ratings to professors. By contrast, moderate and liberal Republicans hold quite different views: More offer warm (49%) than cold (20%) assessments of professors.
