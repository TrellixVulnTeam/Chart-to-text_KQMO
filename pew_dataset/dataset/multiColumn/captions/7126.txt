Last week, the public continued to track economic news more closely than other major stories. More than three-in-ten (31%) say they followed reports about the condition of the economy most closely, while two-in-ten say they followed reports about the hijacking of a U.S. cargo ship by Somali pirates more closely than any other story. A separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ) found those two stories received the most coverage as well. Economic news took up 13% of the newshole (counting stories about state and local budget troubles separately). The standoff between Somali pirates and the U.S. Navy – and its dramatic conclusion on April 12 – took up 14%.
