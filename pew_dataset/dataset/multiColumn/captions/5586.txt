However, fewer than half (45%) of all Americans surveyed last year said they believe the U.S. has made substantial progress toward racial equality since 1963, when King delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech in Washington. Roughly half of Americans (49%) said “a lot more” needs to be done to achieve racial equality. Broken down by race, a higher share of blacks (79%) than Hispanics (48%) and whites (44%) felt that way, according to a Pew Research Center report.
