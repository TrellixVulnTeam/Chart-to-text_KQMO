In India, a majority of the public (55%) has a favorable view of the U. S., including 30% with a very positive outlook, according to a Pew Research survey conducted last spring. Only 16% see the U.S. unfavorably, while 29% offer no opinion. These high ratings are essentially unchanged from late last year, when 56% of the Indian public gave the U.S. positive marks.
This positive view is not shared equally among all groups in India. Younger Indians, age 18-29, are more likely than those age 50 and older to see the U.S. in a favorable light (59% v. 47%). Higher educated people (65%) also view the U.S. more positively than those with less education (47%). Men (59%) are more favorable to the U.S. than women (49%), though 40% of women express no opinion. And those with higher incomes (57%) are slightly more pro-American than lower income Indians (49%).
As with Indians’ views of the U.S., Americans’ regard for India differs by gender, income and education. Men (60%) and those who are better educated (59%) are more likely than women (51%) and those with less education (50%) to have a favorable view of India. Higher income Americans (63%) also see India more positively, though about half with lower incomes (51%) share this sentiment.
