Two foreign policy stories rounded out the news index for the week. The historic talks between the United States and Iran regarding the situation in Iraq were followed very closely by 19% of the public. Only 3% said this was the story they followed most closely. Interest in U.S.-Iranian relations was higher in February of this year when tensions were mounting between the two nations.
Darfur was back in the news last week as President Bush announced that the U.S. would impose new sanctions against Sudan. Only 12% of the public followed news about Darfur very closely and 2% listed this as their most closely followed story. However, there are signs that the public would like to hear more about the violence in Darfur. When asked whether news organizations are giving too much, too little, or the right amount of coverage to ethnic violence in Darfur, a plurality of the public (49%), says the issue is getting too little coverage. Only 10% say Darfur has gotten too much coverage and 27% say it has gotten the right amount of coverage.
