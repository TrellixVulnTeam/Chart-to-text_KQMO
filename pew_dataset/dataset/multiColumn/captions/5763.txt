While the courtâ€™s favorability declined this year, partisan differences in opinions about it narrowed. Overall, 54% of Democrats in the July survey had a favorable view of the court as did 48% of Republicans, with 47% of independents sharing that view. In a July 2012 survey, after the court upheld the new health care law, the number of Republicans holding a favorable view of the court dropped to 38% compared to 56% who had a positive view in April. After the health care decision, the number of Democrats expressing a favorable view increased 12 points, from 52% to 64%.
