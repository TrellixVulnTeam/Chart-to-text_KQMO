While there has been no significant change in party affiliation this year, there are other signs of evangelical frustration with the party. The number of evangelicals who have a favorable opinion of the GOP stood at 74% in the aftermath of the 2004 election. But it dropped to 54% last fall in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, before recovering to 63% earlier in 2006. By July of this year, however, it had declined to 54%, as the partyâ€™s image with the public overall dimmed to 40% favorable.
