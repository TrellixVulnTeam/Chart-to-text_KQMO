Partisans have starkly different ideas about what steps the federal government should take to improve life in the future. Democrats and Republicans differ notably in the policies they believe the federal government should enact to improve life for future generations. About two-thirds of Republicans (65%), for example, say reducing the number of undocumented immigrants coming into the U.S. should be a top priority for the federal government, but just 17% of Democrats agree. And while 83% of Democrats say providing high-quality, affordable health care for all should be a top priority, a much smaller share of Republicans (48%) agree.
