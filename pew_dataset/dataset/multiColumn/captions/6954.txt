About a quarter of the public (24%) say they very closely followed news about the deadly suicide bomb in Afghanistan on Dec. 30 that killed seven CIA employees and a Jordanian intelligence officer; 6% say this was the story they followed most closely last week. The incident accounted for 3% of coverage, according to PEJ.
And with the announcement that several prominent lawmakers would not seek reelection this year, stories about the midterm elections made up 8% of coverage. Two-in-ten Americans say they followed news about the 2010 elections very closely. Just 2% say they followed these stories more closely than any other major news.
