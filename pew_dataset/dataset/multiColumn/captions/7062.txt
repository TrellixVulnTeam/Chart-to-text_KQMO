The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, conducted Aug. 11-17 in English and Spanish among 2,010 adults reached on landlines and cell phones, finds that 51% now approve of Obamaâ€™s job performance while 37% disapprove. While that is largely unchanged from July (54%), it is down 10 points from June (61%).
