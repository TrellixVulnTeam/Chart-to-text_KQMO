Also worth noting is how South Koreans evaluate the U.S. and its leader. Of all the countries surveyed in 2018, South Koreans have one of the most positive evaluations of the U.S., second only to Filipinos and Israelis. Ratings of Trump, however, remain lukewarm, with less than half saying that they have confidence in Trump to do the right thing regarding world affairs. However, this represents a substantial increase from before the first summit, when only 17% of South Koreans had confidence in Trump. Still, the 44% confidence in Trump remains half the level of support Barack Obama had in 2015.
