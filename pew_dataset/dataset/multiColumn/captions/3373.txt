Our August survey revealed a wide gulf in how Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton supporters viewed the country. It found Donald Trump supporters overwhelmingly believed that life in America is worse than it was 50 years ago “for people like them,” while most Hillary Clinton supporters took the opposite view, saying life for people like them has gotten better over the past half-century. The candidates’ supporters also differed in their expectations for the nation’s future. Trump backers were broadly pessimistic, while Clinton supporters had mixed assessments.
