As of January 2016, the top contributors to peacekeeping forces are Ethiopia (8,326), Bangladesh (8,274), India (7,799) and Pakistan (7,625) – making up 30% of the total – followed by other developing and emerging nations, mostly in Africa and Asia. By contrast, European nations supply just 6% of total personnel contributions. (Brahimi criticized this dynamic as one in which the “rich contribute money and the poor contribute blood.”)
