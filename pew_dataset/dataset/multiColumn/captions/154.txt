American views of NATO are shaped by political party affiliation, according to past Pew Research Center surveys. Historically, Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are more likely to express a favorable opinion of the organization than Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. In the summer of 2020, seven-in-ten Democrats had a favorable view of NATO, compared with less than half (46%) of their Republican counterparts, a difference of 24 percentage points.
Among Democrats, NATO favorability has ticked up from 61% in 2019 to 70% this summer. Republican views of the alliance have held steady at roughly half since 2009, although in 2013, a record low of only 43% held a positive view of NATO.
