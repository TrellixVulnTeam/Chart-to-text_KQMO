When asked about the information that advertisers can gather about their child’s online behavior, parents’ concern levels rival and sometimes even exceed worries about their child’s interaction with people they do not know online. In a 2012 survey 81% of parents said they were “very” or “somewhat” concerned about how much information advertisers can learn about their child’s online behavior. By comparison, the combined levels of parental concern regarding their children’s interactions with people they do not know amounts to 72% of all parents.
