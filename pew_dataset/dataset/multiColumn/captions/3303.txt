While the 2016 elections have done little to brighten the public’s overall outlook or raise expectations for partisan cooperation, the Republican Party has seen its standing improve in the wake of Trump’s presidential win and the GOP maintaining control of Congress. Today, about as many hold a favorable (47%) as unfavorable (49%) view of the Republican Party. This is the first time views of the GOP have been about as favorable as unfavorable since 2011. The Democratic Party is rated slightly more positively (51% favorable, 45% unfavorable) than the GOP, but the gap in assessments of the two parties is much narrower than it was just a few weeks before the election, in October 2016.
Furthermore, the GOP has drawn even with the Democrats as the party seen as “more concerned with the needs of people like me:” 45% say this phrase better describes the Democratic Party, while 44% now say it better describes the Republican Party. In July 2015, far more said the Democratic Party (53%) than the Republican Party (31%) was better described by this phrase.
