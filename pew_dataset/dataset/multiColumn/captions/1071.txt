Responding to an open-ended question asking which country or group poses the greatest threat to their country in the future, just 6% of Americans named Iran in spring 2019, prior to the missile strike that killed Soleimani. This figure represents the smallest share naming Iran as Americaâ€™s greatest threat since the question was first asked in 2007. That year, nearly a quarter of Americans chose Iran as the greatest threat to the country. As of 2019, Americans were much more concerned about the threats posed by China (24%), Russia (24%) and North Korea (12%).
