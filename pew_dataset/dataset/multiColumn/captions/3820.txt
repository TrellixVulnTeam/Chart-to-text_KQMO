A spring 2015 Pew Research Center survey also raised questions about the willingness of people in a number of NATO nations to carry through with a key commitment to the alliance. Despite tensions with Russia growing out of the Ukraine conflict, NATO members polled were divided on whether their countries should provide military support to an ally if it got into a military conflict with Russia. A median of 48% across eight NATO nations said their country should use military force to defend allies, while 42% among these members are opposed to using force.
Yet only in the U.S. and Canada did more than half think their country should use military action if Russia attacks a fellow NATO member (56% and 53%, respectively). Germans (58%) were the most likely to say their country should not use military force.
