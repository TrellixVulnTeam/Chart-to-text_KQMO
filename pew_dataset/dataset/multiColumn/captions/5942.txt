The iPhone is, along with Google’s Android, one of the two dominant smartphone platforms in the United States. As of May 2013, according to a recent Pew Research Center report on smartphone ownership, 25% of all U.S. cellphone owners– and 43% of smartphone owners — own an iPhone, a few percentage points behind Android. Other smartphone platforms — Microsoft’s Windows Phone, the fading BlackBerry, the handful of Palms still in use — are far behind.
