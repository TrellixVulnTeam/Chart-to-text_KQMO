Fewer than one-in-five Pakistanis (15%) have a positive view of the U.S. — of the publics included in the 2007 survey, only Palestinians (13%) and Turks (9%) are less favorably disposed. Moreover, despite their own concerns about terrorism, Pakistanis overwhelmingly oppose U.S.-led efforts to fight terrorism — six-in-ten (59%) oppose America’s anti-terror campaign, while only 13% back it. Pakistanis are also leery of American efforts to encourage democracy in their country — 57% believe the U.S. only promotes democracy when it serves its interests, and 72% say they dislike American ideas about democracy.
