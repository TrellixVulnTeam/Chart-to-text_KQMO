And at this point, Republican voters also are more engaged in the campaign than they were at this stage in prior campaigns. Roughly eight-in-ten Republican voters (81%) say they have given a lot or some thought to the 2016 presidential candidates. That compares with 74% who gave at least some thought to the candidates in September 2011 and 69% who did so four years earlier.
Among Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters, 71% say they have given a lot or some thought to the candidates, which is nearly identical to the share who said this eight years ago (72% in September 2007).
