There are also modest associations between two of the Big Five personality dimensions — openness to experience and extraversion — and preferences toward new technology.
Americans with higher openness to experience are more likely to prefer early technology adoption; a third of those more open to experience have a high score on the index, compared with a quarter among those who are lower.
Extroverts are also more likely than introverts to strongly prefer new technology products on this measure (31% for those who score high on extroversion compared with 24% for those who score low).
