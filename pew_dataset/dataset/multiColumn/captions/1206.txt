The most notable change has occurred in attitudes toward taking in refugees. In the earlier survey, 61% said that admitting refugees escaping war and violence was a very or somewhat important goal. In the new survey, the share has increased to 73%.
Shifting views among Republicans account for most of this increase. In 2016, 40% of Republicans said admitting refugees was an important goal. Today, a majority of Republicans (58%) hold this view. The share of Republicans who now say admitting refugees should be a somewhat important goal has risen from 28% in 2016 to 43% today. The proportion who say this should be a very important goal has remained essentially the same (13% in 2016, 15% today).
