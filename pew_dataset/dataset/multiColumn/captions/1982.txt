The same pattern was true for Barack Obama, although Obama’s ratings were on balance higher and steadier than those of his predecessor. They peaked shortly after his election, when 74% of Americans had confidence in Obama to do the right thing internationally and 56% approved of his job performance. While these numbers slipped after the first year of his presidency, around six-in-ten Americans remained confident in Obama on the global stage throughout the rest of his two terms, while his domestic approval ratings hovered in the mid- to high 40s.
So far, Donald Trump has received lower international confidence ratings than Obama, but they are still higher than his overall approval rating in the U.S. In 2018, 48% of Americans have confidence in Trump’s international abilities, while his average job performance rating is at 39%, according to recent Pew Research Center surveys.
