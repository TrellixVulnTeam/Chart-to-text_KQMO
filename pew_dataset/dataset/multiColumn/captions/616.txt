Americansâ€™ observations about mask-wearing behavior in the areas where they live vary by the severity of COVID-19 health impacts in the community. About six-in-ten adults (62%) who live in counties with the highest COVID-19 death rates say that all or most people in their communities are wearing masks, compared with 33% of those who live in areas that have the lowest number of coronavirus deaths per capita.
