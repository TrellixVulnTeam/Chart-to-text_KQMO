Amid increased violence and mounting casualties in Iraq, opinions about the war have changed only marginally over the past several weeks. Since early September, however, opinions on several key measures on the war have grown more negative. Just 43% of Americans now believe the U.S. made the right decision in using military force against Iraq, down from 49% in early September. And the number saying the U.S. military effort is not going well has risen from 48% in early September to 59% in the current survey.
