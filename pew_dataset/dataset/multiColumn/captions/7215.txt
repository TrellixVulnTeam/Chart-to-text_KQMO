A technology userâ€™s experience and ease with new technologies may play a role in his chosen solution as well as in his attitude during the course trying to solve the problem. Adults who admitted that they need help setting up or learning how to use a new device (48% of internet and cell phone users) are significantly more likely than those who are at ease setting up new device to seek help from family or friends in order to fix a broken device (21% vs. 9%). Those tech users who need help with new devices are also significantly more likely to feel confused (55% vs. 29%) and discouraged (55% vs. 44%) during the course of trying to solve the problem.
The 52% of tech users who are comfortable learning to use new devices on their own are more likely to be independent and confident device fixers. Some 35% of this group, compared with 19% of those who need help with new devices, fixed broken technology on their own; and, 81% of the more tech-savvy group said they felt confident during the course of fixing their devices, while 62% of those who need with devices help felt confident. Both groups, however, are equally likely to contact user support for help and are equally likely to fix their broken devices in the end.
