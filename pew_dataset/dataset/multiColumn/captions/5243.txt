Job growth for recent journalism and mass communication grads stalled in 2013 with minority students hit particularly hard by the slowdown, according to a new University of Georgia survey of nearly 1,800 bachelor’s and master’s degree recipients.
In 2013, 65% of bachelor’s degree holders in journalism and mass communication found full-time work six to eight months after graduation, a slight decrease from 65.6% in 2013 and the first decline since 2009, when the recession was at its peak. Additionally, unemployment for the recent graduates rose to 12.2% in 2013, up from 10.7% in 2012. That jobless number, however, is equal to the overall rate for 20-24 year olds.
For minorities, the news from the job market was worse. Only 55.1% of the 2013 minority bachelor’s degree recipients reported full-time employment at the time they returned the survey, down significantly from 60.3% in 2012. The non-minority employment rate of 72.8% was unchanged from the previous year and stood 18 percentage points higher than minorities. That represents the highest discrepancy recorded in the 27 years that Dr. Lee Becker has conducted the survey.
