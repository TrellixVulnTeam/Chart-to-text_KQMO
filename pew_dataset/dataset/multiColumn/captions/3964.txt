Another aspect of campaigns that is frowned upon by voters is the use of personal insults by candidates. In a race that has been punctuated by harsh personal attacks, 68% of voters say that “personally insulting political opponents is never fair game.” Just 30% say personal attacks are sometimes fair game.
Majorities of both Republican (60%) and Democratic voters (74%) say that personally insulting political opponents is never fair game. Majorities of supporters of most candidates say that personal insults are “never fair game” but supporters of Trump are divided, with nearly half saying personal insults are sometimes fair game.
Nearly as many Republican voters supporting Trump say personally insulting an opponent is sometimes fair game (47%) as say such insults are never fair game (51%). Among Republican supporters of Cruz and Kasich, nearly two-thirds or more say personal insults are never fair game. Fully three-quarters of Democratic voters supporting Clinton (74%) or supporting Sanders (74%) say that personally insulting political opponents is never acceptable.
