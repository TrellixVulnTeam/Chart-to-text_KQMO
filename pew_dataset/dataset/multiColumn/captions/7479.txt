While coverage of Bush’s decision to commute Libby’s sentence was not quite as intense as coverage of the verdict had been, public interest in the story increased significantly. During Libby’s trial less than 10% of the public followed the story very closely, and just 13% paid very close attention to his guilty verdict in March. But 27% of the public paid very close attention to news of Bush’s decision to commute Libby’s sentence. Democrats are more interested than Republicans in this latest chapter (34% vs. 22% followed the Libby news very closely). Roughly one-in-ten Americans listed the Libby story as the one they followed more closely than any other this past week.
A quarter of the public (24%) followed news about the 2008 campaign very closely last week, and 10% listed this as their most closely followed story. The campaign was the third most heavily covered news story (8% of the newshole), and the dominant theme of the coverage was the candidates’ second-quarter fundraising totals. As has been the case for much of this year, Democrats paid closer attention than Republicans to campaign news (33% vs. 21% followed very closely).
The widespread flooding in Texas and the plains states attracted nearly as much interest as the presidential campaign, though much less news coverage. Roughly one-in-five Americans (21%) followed the floods very closely and 10% listed this as their most closely followed story. The national news media devoted 3% of its overall coverage to this story.
The Iraq policy debate heated up again last week, as prominent Republicans continued to speak out against the current administration’s policy. More than a quarter of the public (27%) paid very close attention to the debate in Washington over U.S. policy in Iraq, but only 4% listed this as their most closely followed story of the week. This story constituted 3% of the overall newshole.
