Pakistanis are also more optimistic about their countryâ€™s economic future than they were a year ago. Today, a 36%-plurality believes the economy will improve over the next 12 months, a 10 point increase since last year. Just 17% think the economy will worsen, down from 60% in 2011, which was the peak of pessimistic attitudes. Less than a quarter (21%) say the economic situation will remain the same.
