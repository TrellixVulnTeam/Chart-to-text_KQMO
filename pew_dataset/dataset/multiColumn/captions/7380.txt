Public interest in economic news remained high last week as 40% of Americans followed news about the condition of the U.S. economy very closely. Nearly one-in-four Americans (23%) listed the economy as the single news story they were following more closely than any other, placing it second only to the presidential campaign.
Interest in economic news last week was nearly on par with interest in the presidential campaign â€” 37% of the public say they followed campaign news very closely last week, and 32% listed this as their most closely followed story. However, there was far more news coverage devoted to the presidential campaign than to the economy. Last week the media devoted 7% of its overall coverage to economic news, while 51% of the coverage was devoted to the campaign. This was the highest level of campaign coverage recorded so far this year, according to the Project for Excellence in Journalism. Campaign coverage was particularly dominant on cable news networks; fully 76% of the cable newshole was devoted to the campaign.
