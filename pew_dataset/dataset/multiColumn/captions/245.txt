Children ages 11 and younger also engage with Instagram, though not as much as with other sites. Despite most social media sites having age guidelines in place, which usually restrict children younger than 13 from joining, some 5% of parents of a child age 11 or younger say that, as far as they know, their child uses Instagram, according to a 2020 survey. When considering only children ages 9 to 11, however, this share increases to 11%. Platforms like TikTok and Snapchat are more popular than Instagram among children 11 and younger, according to their parents.
