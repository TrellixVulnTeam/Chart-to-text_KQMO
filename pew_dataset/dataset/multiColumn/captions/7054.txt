In addition to opposing new troop commitments, many in NATO countries want troops withdrawn altogether. In France, Germany and Spain, opinion is almost evenly divided between those who support keeping troops in Afghanistan until the situation there has stabilized and those who want troops removed as soon as possible. However, in all three countries support for keeping troops has increased slightly since last year.
There has been little change in opinion in Britain, where 46% support keeping troops in Afghanistan and 48% want forces removed. Poles (30% keep troops, 57% remove troops) and Turks (15% keep troops, 63% remove troops) are overwhelmingly in favor of removing troops, but support for keeping them in Afghanistan is up slightly from 2008.
