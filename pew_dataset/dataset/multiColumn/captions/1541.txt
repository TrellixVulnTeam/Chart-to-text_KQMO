Among unauthorized immigrants in the U.S., there not only was a rise in the share with a college degree between 2007 and 2016; there also was a decline in the share without a high school diploma. In 2016, 44% of unauthorized immigrant adults ages 25 to 64 lacked a high school diploma, compared with 47% in 2007.
In this age group, the change was more dramatic among those who came to the U.S. within the previous five years: 31% lacked a high school diploma in 2016, compared with 44% in 2007.
