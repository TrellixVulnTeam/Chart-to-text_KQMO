Slightly more than half of U.S. adults (54%) said in a Pew Research Center survey conducted in May 2017 that they were somewhat or very worried about the development of driverless vehicles, while 40% said they were at least somewhat enthusiastic about it. A majority of U.S. adults (56%) also said they would not personally want to ride in a driverless car if they had the opportunity, compared with 44% who would.
The most common reasons cited by Americans who said they would not personally want to ride in a self-driving car were a lack of trust or fear of giving up control to a machine (42%) and other specific safety concerns (30%).
Among those who said they would want to ride in a self-driving car, the largest share (37%) cited a love of technology and/or a desire for an exciting or new experience. Another 17% pointed to safety in the belief that a driverless car would be safer than a car driven by a human.
