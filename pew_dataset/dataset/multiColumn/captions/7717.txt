The American public is not happy with the nation’s political leadership. President Bush’s approval rating remains below 50%, and just 39% approve of the job performance of Republican congressional leaders. Despite the paltry ratings for GOP leaders, however, Democrats have failed to benefit. The public has about the same low regard for the job performance of Democratic leaders as for the Republicans (37% approval).
Public attitudes toward leaders in both parties have not changed much over the past year, but have declined markedly over the longer term. In early 2003, at the start of the last congressional session, job approval ratings for both the president and GOP congressional leaders were significantly higher (58%, 48% respectively). And in early 2002, only a few months after the 9/11 attacks, Americans were more unified behind the government and its leaders.
