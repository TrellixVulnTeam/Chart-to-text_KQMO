Along with their concerns, U.S. Muslims also report a host of positive feelings about life in the U.S. Even as most say that Americans do not view Islam as mainstream, for example, majorities of U.S. Muslims (60%) say they have “a lot” in common with most Americans, and that they can get ahead through hard work (70%) – a belief that is a key component of the so-called American dream.
U.S. Muslims also appear to be more socially integrated with non-Muslims than they were a decade ago. About one-third (36%) of U.S. Muslims say that all or most of their friends are Muslim, down from 47% who said that in 2007. Many report positive interactions with non-Muslims by another measure, as well: 49% say that someone expressed support for them because they are Muslim in the 12 months prior to the survey, up from 32% who said this in 2007.
