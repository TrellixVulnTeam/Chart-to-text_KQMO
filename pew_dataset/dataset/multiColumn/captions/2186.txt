For instance, 78% of Republicans and Republican leaners living in districts that Republican candidates for Congress won by wide margins in 2016 said the quality of those who ran for Congress in the last several elections was very or somewhat good, compared with 53% of Democrats in these districts. Similarly, while 71% of Democrats and Democratic leaners in safe Democratic districts said candidate quality in their district had generally been good, that compares with just 50% of Republicans and Republican leaners in these districts.
