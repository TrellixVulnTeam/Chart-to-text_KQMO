The median age among foreign-born Latinos is more than 20 years older than that of U.S.-born Latinos (41 and 19, respectively). While the median age of foreign-born Latinos has risen dramatically over the past three decades (from 31 years in 1980), the median age of U.S.-born Latinos has not changed significantly. Much of this change in the median age among foreign-born Latinos reflects the slowdown in migration from Latin America that has occurred since 2007. Without a new, large wave of younger immigrants, those Latino immigrants who remain in the U.S. have aged, pushing up the groupâ€™s median age.
