The Iraq war was the news story the public followed most closely last week. Nearly a third of the public (32%) followed news about the situation in Iraq very closely and 25% listed this as the story they followed most closely. The percentage of Americans following the war has remained remarkably steady throughout the year. The national news media devoted 10% of its overall coverage to events in Iraq last week and 5% to the Iraq policy debate.
Coverage of the Iraq policy debate declined sharply from the previous week when Gen. Petraeus’ report to Congress and Bush’s prime-time address made it the top news story. Public interest in the story remained unchanged from the previous week: 25% followed the Iraq policy debate very closely and 9% said this was the story they followed most closely.
