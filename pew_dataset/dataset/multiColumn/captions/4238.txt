Turks are generally dissatisfied with the state of their country. Just over half (54%) are dissatisfied with the way things are going in Turkey, while 44% are satisfied. Dissatisfaction has grown since 2013, when 48% were unhappy with the state of the nation. However, it is important to note that from 2002 to 2010, Turks were generally distressed about their countryâ€™s direction. Only in recent years have opinions become somewhat more optimistic.
