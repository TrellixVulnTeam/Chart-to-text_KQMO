Finally, the survey found that a number of religious groups are largely comprised of immigrants: The vast majority (87%) of Hindu adults living in the U.S. are first-generation immigrants, while about six-in-ten American Muslims (61%) in the survey were born overseas. Among Christian traditions, Orthodox Christians have the greatest share of members born abroad (40%), a significantly higher percentage than the 27% of Catholics who are first-generation immigrants.
