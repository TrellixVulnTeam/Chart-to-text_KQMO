By a 47%-39% margin, more Americans say they expect a health care reform bill to pass over the next year than say they do not. While still a plurality opinion, the percentage expecting passage of a health care bill has dropped since mid-October, just after the Senate Finance Committee approved legislation with the support of one Republican, Olympia Snowe of Maine. Since mid-October, opinion on this question has declined 10 points, with Republicans, Democrats and independents all less likely to say they think a health care reform bill will pass over the next year.
