Italy only needs to receive about 10,000 more refugees by Dec. 31 to overtake Greece in number of refugee arrivals in 2016. Already, Italy has received more refugees than it did in all of 2015 (153,842) and is quickly approaching its 2014 refugee total (170,100).
One of the reasons the overall number of refugees to Europe is down is a March 2016 agreement between Turkey and the European Union that requires the return of any new asylum-seekers traveling from Turkey. Since the agreement, the number of Syrian refugees in neighboring Turkey has remained stable, and relatively few asylum-seekers from Syria have made the journey to Greece.
