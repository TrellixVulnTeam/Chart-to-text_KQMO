Mexicans’ optimism about their government’s progress against drug traffickers has dipped. Roughly four-in-ten (39%) believe the government is making progress against drug traffickers, down 6 points since last year.
In mid-February 2014, Mexican officials, working with U.S. anti-drug forces, captured the notorious Sinaloa cartel leader known as “El Chapo.” The boost in the share of Mexicans saying in the spring 2014 survey that their government was making progress against drug traffickers came shortly after his capture. However, this view of progress made by the campaign faded over the course of the year to present levels, even before El Chapo’s second escape from prison in July.
