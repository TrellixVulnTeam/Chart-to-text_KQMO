The shift in the distribution of Hispanic construction workers across regions is consistent with regional trends in the housing market. As shown in Figure 1, trends in housing starts have differed across regions in the past three years. The Northeast and the South witnessed stronger growth in 2004 and 2005 in comparison with the Midwest and the West.
Housing activity diminished in all regions starting in 2006, but the level of activity remained strong in the Northeast and South. In particular, housing activity in the Northeast and the South was at about the same level near the end of 2006 as it was at the beginning of 2004. However, housing starts in the Midwest and the West were well below the levels seen in early 2004. Consequently, it is possible that at least some of the movement of Latino workers across regions was caused by variations in the housing market.
