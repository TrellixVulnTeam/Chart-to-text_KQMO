The proportion saying they very closely followed developments involving the death of pop superstar Michael Jackson stands at 17%; down from the 30% that said they were following the story very closely immediately after Jackson’s sudden death on June 25. Still, developments accounted for 4% of the newshole last week – making PEJ’s top five stories – as authorities continued to investigate the role Jackson’s doctors may have played in his death; 15% say this was the story they followed most closely.
Close to two-in-ten (18%) say they very closely followed reports about the popularity of the government’s “Cash-for-Clunkers” car trade-in program, which appeared to run through most of its original $1 billion allocation last week; 5% say they followed this story more closely than any other. The story made up 2% of the newshole.
Meanwhile, 18% say they followed reports about the Iranian government’s crackdown on opposition protesters very closely, though just 3% say they followed this story more closely than any other. In mid-June, about three-in-ten said they were following the Iranian crackdown on election protestors very closely.
