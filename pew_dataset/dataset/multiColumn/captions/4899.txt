The publicâ€™s views of torture against suspected terrorists have remained generally stable over the past decade. One-in-five (20%) say the use of torture against suspected terrorists can often be justified to gain important information. About three-in-ten (31%) say it can sometimes be justified, 20% think it can rarely be justified, and 27% say it can never be justified.
Among Republicans, three-in-ten (30%) think that the use of torture against suspected terrorists can often be justified, 38% sometimes justified, 16% rarely justified, and 11% never justified. Just 11% of Democrats say this practice can often be justified, 25% sometimes, 21% rarely, and a plurality (40%) say it can never be justified.
In both parties, there is an ideological divide in terms of these attitudes. While 35% of conservative Republicans say torture to gain information from suspected terrorists can often be justified, just 21% of moderate and liberal Republicans agree. And about half (51%) of liberal Democrats say the use of torture can never be justified, compared with 32% of moderates and conservatives in the party.
