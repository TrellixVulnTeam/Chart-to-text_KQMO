A downward trajectory in trust in government also is seen across racial and ethnic lines. Currently, white non-Hispanics, black non-Hispanics and Hispanics all express historically low levels of trust in government. During the Republican presidencies of Reagan and G.W. Bush more whites than blacks said they trusted the government to do the right thing. Conversely, during the Democratic administrations of Clinton and Obama blacks were more likely than whites to express trust in government.
