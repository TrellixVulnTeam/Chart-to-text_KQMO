The presidential campaign dominated news coverage last week, with roughly half of the newshole (49%) devoted to the tight nomination contests in both political parties, according to the Project for Excellence in Journalism’s tracking of news content. Public interest in the campaign has increased but campaign news has not necessarily dominated the public’s focus to the same extent. Just over a third (34%) say the campaign is the story they followed most closely last week, up 12 points from early December (Dec. 2-7). But many also say the assassination of Benazir Bhutto (21%), the tiger attack at the San Francisco zoo (10%), and news from Iraq (10%) were the stories they followed most closely.
