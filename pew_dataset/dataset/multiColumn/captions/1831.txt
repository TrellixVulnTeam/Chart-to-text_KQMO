Since Maduro took office in 2013, Venezuelans’ evaluations of their national economy have worsened. Today, 83% say the current economic situation in Venezuela is bad, including 60% who say that it’s very bad. Those ages 18 to 29 (86%) are slightly more likely than people 50 and older to say the economy is in poor shape (75%). Views of the national economy are also heavily colored by partisanship. Whereas about six-in-ten PSUV supporters say the economy is in poor shape (59%), nine-in-ten non-PSUV supporters say the same.
