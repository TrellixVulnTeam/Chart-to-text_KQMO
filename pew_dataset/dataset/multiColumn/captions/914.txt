A 46% plurality of U.S. adults say Trump did something wrong regarding Ukraine and that it was enough to justify his removal from office, according to the Centerâ€™s survey. Another 28% say Trump did something wrong but that it was not enough to warrant his removal, while 25% say he did nothing wrong.
Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are far more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners to believe that Trump did something wrong related to Ukraine and that it warranted his removal. Eight-in-ten Democrats say this, versus just 7% of Republicans. Around four-in-ten Republicans (41%) say Trump did something wrong but that it was not enough to warrant his removal, while 51% say he did nothing wrong.
