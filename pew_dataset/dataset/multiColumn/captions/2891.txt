Americans’ attitudes toward offensive content online also tend to differ by political affiliation. The survey asked respondents to choose which statement came closer to their view: “Many people take offensive content they see online too seriously” or “offensive content online is too often excused as not a big deal.” By a 63%-36% margin, Republicans say people take offensive online content too seriously. By contrast, Democrats are more divided: 50% say offensive content is often taken too seriously, while 48% feel it is too often excused as not a big deal.
