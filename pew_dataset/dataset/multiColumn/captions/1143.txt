This pattern is not uniformly the case, however. People in France and the UK stand out for being much less optimistic than their counterparts in nations with similar youth unemployment rates. French and British adults, in fact, are about as pessimistic about the financial future of the next generation as people in Italy, Spain and Greece â€“ even though France and the UK have youth unemployment rates that are roughly 10 to 20 percentage points lower.
