After the health care debate and the economy, the public continued to closely follow news about the war in Afghanistan. More than a third (35%) say they followed news about Afghanistan very closely; 12% say this was the news they followed most closely. According to PEJ, the media allocated 5% of newshole to Afghanistan, a significant drop from one week earlier as Obama announced his new war strategy. That week, the war took up 27% of the newshole.
Two-in-ten say they very closely followed the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Obama in Oslo, while 9% say this was the story they followed most closely. Obama’s trip and speech at the award ceremony received 4% of the coverage as measured by PEJ. Democrats were much more likely than Republicans or independents to have followed this story closely.

About 3% of that was specifically tied to the international summit in Copenhagen.
About two-in-ten (21%) say they very closely followed reports about the arrests in Pakistan of five Muslim American men with suspected ties to terrorists; 5% say this was their most closely followed story of the week. The story line made up 3% of news coverage.
