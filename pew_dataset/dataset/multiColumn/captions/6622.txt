Last week, foreign news dominated the publicâ€™s news interest with more than seven-in-ten saying they tracked either news about Japan (57%) or about allied air strikes in Libya (15%) more closely than any other news. That is rarely the case for this index, which measures public interest in a wide range of stories.
In mid-October of last year, 40% said the dramatic rescue of a crew of Chilean miners trapped in an underground mine was their top story of the week. Despite the fast approaching congressional elections, nothing else came close.
