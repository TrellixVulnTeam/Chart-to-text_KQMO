One factor in men’s optimism is their rosy view of what lies ahead for their children. In 27 of 44 countries men are more likely than women to think that the next generation will have a better life. The men in West Africa are the most confident about this. The least confident about the next generation’s prospects are Guatemalan men (75% think children will be worse off) Japanese women (71%) and German women (68%). Strikingly, more than half the men in Western Europe, Eastern and Southern Africa and the Conflict Area plus more than half the women in North America, Western Europe and Eastern and Southern Africa think the future will be worse for children. The greatest disparity in views about children’s future is in Canada, where 45% of men but only 24% of women think children will have it better.
