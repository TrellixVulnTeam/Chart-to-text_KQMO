Solid majorities favor both initiating talks with Iran and Syria to encourage cooperation on Iraq (66%), and trying harder to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (59%). An April 2007 Pew survey finds that opinion on these proposals has changed little since December, when they were first recommended by the panel led by James Baker and Lee Hamilton.
Support for shifting the primary mission of U.S. troops from fighting insurgents to supporting the Iraqi army as declined somewhat from December, although a majority still supports the idea; 55% favor this proposal now, compared with 62% in December.
The most contentious recommendation by the Baker-Hamilton commission was that the U.S. should end its support of the Iraqi government if it failed to make substantial progress. A narrow majority (52%) supports this proposal, while 36% are opposed. Opinion on this proposal is also virtually unchanged since December when 52% favored the recommendations and 38% opposed it.
