4 Women from nine countries and one American territory account for more than half of all babies born to foreign-born women in the U.S. Births to women from Mexico, China, India, El Salvador, Guatemala, the Philippines, Honduras, Vietnam, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico accounted for 58% of all births to immigrant mothers in the U.S. in 2014.
Beyond marital status, new immigrant moms vary dramatically on a variety of characteristics depending on where they are from. For instance, about 4% of new foreign-born mothers from India – one of the top 10 countries of origin among new foreign-born moms – are living in poverty, compared with 49% of new mothers from Honduras. And new mothers from Vietnam, the Philippines and China are particularly likely to be older mothers. The new foreign-born mother’s likelihood of being married also varies significantly: Two-thirds of births to mothers from Honduras occurred outside of marriage, while virtually all births to Indian moms occurred within marriage.
