In each of the 10 years Pew Research Center has been tracking religious restrictions (2007 to 2016), China has been near the top of the list of most restrictive governments. In 2016, the most recent year for which the Center has religious restrictions data, the Chinese government was the most restrictive toward religious groups among all the 198 countries included in the study (it scored 8.8 out of 10 on the Government Restrictions Index).
