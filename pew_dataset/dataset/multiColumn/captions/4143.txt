Wide partisan divides exist over whether the U.S. should send ground troops. Two-thirds of Republicans (66%) – including 72% of conservative Republicans – say they would favor sending U.S. ground troops to Iraq and Syria, while just 28% are opposed. Among Democrats, views are the reverse: 64% oppose sending ground troops to Iraq and Syria, 33% are in favor. Among independents, about as many favor (48%) as oppose (47%) the use of U.S. ground forces to fight Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria. Views among partisan groups are little different than they were in July 2015.
