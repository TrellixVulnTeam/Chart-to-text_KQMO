Overall, 40% say that the job situation is the national economic issue that worries them most, while somewhat fewer cite the budget deficit (24%) or rising prices (22%); just 10% say the condition of the financial and housing markets is their top economic worry.
The percentage citing the job situation as their top economic worry has increased eight points since March, when concern over rising prices rivaled the job situation as the public’s top economic worry. For most of the past three years, the job situation has been the public’s top economic worry.
