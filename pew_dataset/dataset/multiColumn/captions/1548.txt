But even as MEPs have gained in power, EU citizens seem to have grown less interested in choosing them. In the first European Parliament elections in 1979, 62% of registered voters in the nine participating countries voted. Overall turnout has fallen in every election since: In 2014, just 43% of the 396.1 million registered voters cast ballots. In most EU countries, turnout in European Parliament elections typically lags well behind that in national elections.
