Texting is by far the most frequent way teens interact with their romantic partner. Nearly three-quarters (72%) of teen daters say they spend time texting with their partner daily. Among teens who have had relationships, talking on the phone (39%) ranks second for everyday interactions, followed by instant messaging (29%), being together in person (21%), social media (21%) and messaging apps (20%). Fewer teen daters interact daily with their romantic partner by video chatting, emailing or playing video games.
