Among Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters, somewhat more say they want the Democratic Party to move in a more moderate (53%) than more liberal (40%) direction. These views are about the same as they were following the 2014 midterm elections. In November 2016, after Trumpâ€™s presidential election victory, a somewhat greater share of Democrats (49%) wanted the party to head in a more liberal direction.
