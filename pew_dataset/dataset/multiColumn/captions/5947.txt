South Africans appear to recognize the competing economic influence of the two world powers – and to welcome ties with both countries. According to a new Pew Research Center poll, about seven-in-ten (72%) say the U.S. has a great deal or fair amount of influence on economic conditions in South Africa; 71% say the same about China. Among those who believe the U.S. and China have a significant economic impact on their country, majorities say both nations’ influence is a good thing for South Africa: 67% for the U.S. and 58% for China.
