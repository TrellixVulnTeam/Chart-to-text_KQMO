The latest allegations in the child sex abuse scandal at Penn State University rivaled news about the 2012 elections and the economy for the public’s attention last week.
About two-in-ten (19%) say news about the candidates for the 2012 presidential elections was their top story, while 18% each say they followed news about the economy or the Penn State scandal most closely, according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey, conducted Dec. 8-11 by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press among 1,008 adults.
With Newt Gingrich’s rise to the top of the Republican field and the Iowa caucuses just weeks away, the 2012 presidential campaign received more coverage than any other story. The campaign accounted for 24% of the newshole last week, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ).
