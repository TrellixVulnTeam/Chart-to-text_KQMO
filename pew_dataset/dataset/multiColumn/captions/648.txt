The survey also asked the public to rate the ethical standards of police officers, a question that revealed similar demographic differences. While nearly three-quarters of the public said they would rate the ethical standards of police officers highly, just 52% of black adults said the same.
Views also differed by age. Adults ages 18 to 29 gave officers the lowest marks, with about six-in-ten (61%) saying they would rate officersâ€™ ethical standards as high or very high. Adults 65 and older were 22 percentage points more likely to rate their ethical standards as high or very high (83%).
