The improvement in the Republican Party’s favorability rating is most pronounced among independents who lean toward the GOP. In the wake of Trump’s victory, about seven-in-ten Republican leaners (72%) have a favorable opinion of the GOP, which is up 15 points since October and 29 points since April.
Republicans are about as favorable toward their party today (83%) as they were in October (82%), though ratings have improved 15 points since the spring. Democratic views of the GOP have also ticked more positive than in recent months, though just 20% of Democrats and 27% of Democratic leaners view the Republican Party favorably.
While overall ratings of the Democratic Party are unchanged since the fall, there have been shifts in views among subgroups over this period. Favorable views of the Democratic Party are down slightly among Democrats (88% today, from 94% in October), but they are unchanged among Democratic leaners. Both Republicans (up 8 points) and Republican leaners (up 9 points) are somewhat more likely to rate the Democratic Party favorably today than they were in October.
