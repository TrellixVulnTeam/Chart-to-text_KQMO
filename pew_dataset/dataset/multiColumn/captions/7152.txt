The economic crisis and the administration’s response continued to be the top stories last week in terms of both public interest and media coverage. About a third of Americans (34%) say they followed news about the condition of the U.S. economy more closely than any other story last week, according to the latest News Interest Index survey conducted Feb. 27-March 2 by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. Another 23% list President Obama’s budget proposal – with its mix of priority shifts and new spending to address current and longer-term concerns – as their top story of the week.
The crisis and efforts to stop the economic slide also dominated news coverage. According to the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ), 26% of the newshole was devoted to economic storylines. Obama’s budget proposal took up another 12% and the president’s policy speech before Congress accounted for another 10% of the newshole.
