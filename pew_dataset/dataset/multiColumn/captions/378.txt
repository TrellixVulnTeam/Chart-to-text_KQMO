A median of 34% across the 13 countries surveyed believe the U.S. is the world’s leading economic power, while almost half (48%) say the same of China.
South Korea and Japan – the two nations geographically closest to China among those surveyed – are the only countries where the U.S. is the most common choice for the leading economic power. In Australia, Canada and the European countries surveyed, China is the top choice.
Overall, very few say the countries of the European Union are the world’s leading economic power, though 18% in Germany and 16% in Denmark hold this view.
