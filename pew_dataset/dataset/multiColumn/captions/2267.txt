The share of countries with “high” or “very high” levels of social hostilities involving religion remained stable at 27%. Countries in these two categories scored at least a 3.6 on the Social Hostilities Index, a 10-point scale based on 13 measures of social hostilities involving religion, including tensions between religious groups and religion-related terrorism. Although the share of countries in these categories did not change since last year, it was higher than in 2007, when this study began tracking social hostilities. In addition, several countries joined these top two categories of social hostilities in 2016. Bangladesh experienced an increase in assaults and killings of members of religious groups by social groups or individuals – including multiple instances where people who had expressed atheist views or were accused of offending Islam on the internet were killed or threatened.
