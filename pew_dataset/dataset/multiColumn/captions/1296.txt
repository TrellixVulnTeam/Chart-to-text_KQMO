Americans’ views of the UN have generally remained steady, but partisan divides have widened since 2013. The share of Democrats who have a positive view of the UN is generally higher than the share of Republicans who say the same, but the partisan gap has been especially large since 2013. That year, 72% of Democrats and 41% of Republicans expressed a favorable view – a difference of 31 percentage points. This year, Democrats are 41 points more likely than Republicans to see the UN positively (77% vs. 36%). The share of Republicans who currently have a favorable view of the UN is at its lowest point in almost 30 years of Pew Research Center surveys.
