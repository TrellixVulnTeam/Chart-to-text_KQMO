Democratsâ€™ early preferences for the 2016 election are similar to those at a comparable point in the 2008 election in one respect: A large share of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say there is a good chance they would vote for Hillary Clinton. Nearly six-in-ten (59%) Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say that today; 52% said that at a comparable point in the campaign eight years ago.
But the Democratic field in 2007 was very different than it is today. Currently, about one-in-five Democrats say there is a good chance they would vote for Joe Biden (22%) if he were to decide to run and about as many say the same about Elizabeth Warren (21%), who has repeatedly indicated no interest in being a candidate.
