People are divided in their perceptions of how powerful a role the U.S. plays on the world stage compared with 10 years ago. A global median of 35% say the country is as important on the world stage as before, while 31% say it plays a more important role and 25% say it plays a less important role. Individually, most countries say the U.S. role has either grown or remains as important as before. Around half or more in Nigeria (54%), Israel (54%) and Kenya (51%) say the U.S. has grown in power and influence.
Japan stands out as the only country where a majority of people think the U.S. plays a less important role than it did 10 years ago. Only 16% of Japanese think the U.S. has grown in influence, equal to the share of Germans who say the same.
