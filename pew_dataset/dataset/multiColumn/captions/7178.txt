The public also remains interested in news about the U.S. economy, though the percent of Americans following the financial crisis very closely has slipped considerably since its high in late September amid talk of an imminent global economic meltdown. About four-in-ten (43%) say they were following news about the economy very closely last week, which is little changed since early January (42%). In late September, 70% said they were tracking economic news very closely.
While the percent of Americans following economic news very closely has gotten smaller since September, the public remains highly concerned about the nation’s economic health and rising unemployment. Strengthening the economy and improving the job situation top the public’s list of priorities for 2009 [See “Economy, Jobs Trump All Other Policy Priorities In 2009” released Jan. 22, 2008].
