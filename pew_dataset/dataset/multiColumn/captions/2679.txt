Josef Stalin and Mikhail Gorbachev, the Russian leaders presiding, respectively, over World War II and the fall of the USSR, receive starkly different ratings in Russia. In a 2015 survey, a majority of the Russian public (58%) believed Stalin played a very or mostly positive role in history. Few people (22%) felt the same way about Gorbachev.
