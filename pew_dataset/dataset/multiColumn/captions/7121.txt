As an outbreak of swine flu spreads beyond Mexico into the United States and elsewhere, Americans have started to track the fast developing story closely. The story grew in prominence after the survey went into the field, but 25% of the public say they followed reports about the deadly flu very closely and 21% say this was the story — among six choices — that they followed most closely last week. At this point, the amount of interest is similar to several recent health scares, including the spread of a drug-resistant staph infection in the U.S. in late 2007.
The public also continues to closely track the financial problems facing the U.S. auto industry, particularly Chrysler and General Motors. Three-in-ten say they followed these stories very closely. For almost two-in-ten (18%), this was the story they followed more closely than any other.
Slightly more than one-in-ten (11%) say they were following developments in the debate over whether to set up a bi-partisan commission to investigate the harsh interrogation techniques used by the CIA following the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks more closely than any other story. Two-in-ten (21%) say they followed this story very closely.
The same share (21%) say they were following events in Iraq very closely last week, while 10% say this was the news they followed most closely.
