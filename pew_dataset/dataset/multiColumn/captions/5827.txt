Hispanics now make up one-fourth of all public school studentsâ€”a new demographic milestone. According to the Census Bureau, one out of every four public school students nationwide in October 2012 was Hispanic. The Hispanic share varies across different school levels. For example, among nursery public school students, the Hispanic share stood at 29%; among public school kindergarten students, 27% are Hispanic; and among elementary school students, 25% are Hispanic. Only among public high school students is the Hispanic share (23%) below one-quarter.
