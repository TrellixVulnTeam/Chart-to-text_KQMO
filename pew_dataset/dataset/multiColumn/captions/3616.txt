As the Supreme Court prepares to hear the first of two death penalty cases in this yearâ€™s term, the share of Americans who support the death penalty for people convicted of murder is now at its lowest point in more than four decades.
Only about half of Americans (49%) now favor the death penalty for people convicted of murder, while 42% oppose it. Support has dropped 7 percentage points since March 2015, from 56%. Public support for capital punishment peaked in the mid-1990s, when eight-in-ten Americans (80% in 1994) favored the death penalty and fewer than two-in-ten were opposed (16%). Opposition to the death penalty is now the highest it has been since 1972.
