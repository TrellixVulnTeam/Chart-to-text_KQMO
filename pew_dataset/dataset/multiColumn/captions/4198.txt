Pew Research Center, in collaboration with Abt SRBI, appended two different activity flags (Cell-WINS and Targus) in a large (n=10,013) national dual frame RDD survey in 2014. Half of the interviews in that study were conducted on cellphones and half on landlines. With the Cell-WINS flag, 15% of flagged-inactive cellphone numbers were found to be working and residential (false negatives), and one-in-ten flagged-active numbers were found to be non-working or non-residential (false positives). With the Targus flag, both error rates were higher.
