There are transatlantic differences about defense spending. Successive American presidents have called on NATO allies to spend more on security, and Trump has repeatedly pressed the issue. As our 2017 poll shows, there are significant differences between Americans and Germans on this topic, as well as significant partisan differences within the U.S.
A plurality of Americans (45%) say the countryâ€™s allies in Europe should spend more on their national defense, while 37% say spending levels should stay about the same and only 9% think they should be decreased. But there is a wide partisan gap on this issue, with 63% of Republicans calling for more spending from allies, compared with just 33% of Democrats. When Germans were asked about their own defense spending, only 32% of Germans want to see it increased; roughly half say it should stay where it is, while 13% want it cut.
