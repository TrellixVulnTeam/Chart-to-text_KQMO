As new conflicts emerge, the top origin countries of refugees can change suddenly. But with a growing number of conflicts in the Middle East associated with the Arab Spring, more refugees are fleeing their home countries in the Middle East and North Africa compared with a decade earlier. In 2002, 16% of refugees were born in the Middle East and North Africa, while that share rose to 22% by 2012. Despite this increase, most refugees are still from countries in the Asia-Pacific and sub-Saharan Africa regions.
