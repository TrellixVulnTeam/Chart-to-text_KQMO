Survey experiments also allow researchers to measure how much context matters when asking a question. In an early 2018 survey, researchers asked one group of respondents whether the U.S. Senate should have two seats for every state, regardless of how many people live in the state. A second group of respondents received the same question but were given some additional context – specifically, that the population difference between the nation’s largest and smallest states had grown dramatically over time.
