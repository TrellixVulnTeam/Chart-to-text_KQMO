There are notable demographic, educational and political differences over the war evident in the survey. Substantial majorities of men in every age group ­ no fewer than seven-in-ten ­ think it was the right decision to go to war. Opinion among women varies widely by age, with the oldest and youngest women least likely to support the war. Only about half of women age 75 and older ­ and a similar proportion of those below the age of 25 (52%)­ back the decision to go to war. Among women in all other age groups, at least six-in-ten agree with that decision.
The gender gap in support for war in Iraq is especially large among the youngest and oldest respondents. In the youngest group ­ ages 18-24 ­ just over half of women (52%) say the U.S. made the right decision in going to war, while 82% of men feel this way (a gap of 30 points). And among those ages 25-29, the gap is 21 points (men 85%, women 64%). At the other end of the age spectrum, there also is a large gender gap (23 points). More than seven-in-ten men (73%) age 75 and older say the U.S. made the right decision, compared with only 50% of women. But unlike the youngest women, 44% of whom think war was the wrong decision, older women are no more opposed to military action than their male counterparts. Women age 75 and older are simply much less likely than men to express an opinion about the war at all.
