Seven-in-ten Americans say the U.S. should cooperate more with Germany, but only 41% of Germans say Germany should cooperate more with the U.S. German views on this question have become more negative in the past year: In 2017, a 56% majority of Germans said they should collaborate more with the U.S.
When asked about cooperation with other major powers, Americans and Germans generally agree that their countries should cooperate more with France, the United Kingdom and China. But when it comes to Russia, people in the U.S. and Germany sharply diverge. A majority of Americans (58%) want to cooperate less with their Cold War adversary, while nearly seven-in-ten Germans (69%) want to cooperate more with Russia, the source of about a third of Germanyâ€™s natural gas imports as of 2015.
