Evaluations of Bush’s overall job performance are roughly equal to his ratings on the economy and Iraq, suggesting that favorable personal evaluations and the issue of terrorism are not counterbalancing these more problematic areas in the public’s broader assessment of his performance. Throughout the past year, the president’s overall job approval rating has been significantly higher ­ by anywhere from three to nine points ­ than his rating on the economy and Iraq specifically. Today the president’s overall rating is identical to his rating on the economy and just two points above evaluations of his handling of Iraq. While significantly more approve of Bush’s performance when it comes to terrorist threats, this apparently no longer lifts his overall approval rating as it did earlier in the year.
