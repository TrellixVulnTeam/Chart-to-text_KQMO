Majorities of adults 30 years old and younger (57%) and ages 30-49 (54%) say they would rather have a bigger government providing more services. Fewer adults ages 50-64 (38%) and adults ages 65 and older (40%) say this.
Those with family incomes of $75,000 or more are much less likely than those with lower incomes to say theyâ€™d prefer a bigger government that provides more services. Just about a third of those earning $75,000 or more (35%) say this, compared to 44% of those with family incomes between $30,000 and $75,000 and nearly two-thirds (64%) of those making less than $30,000 a year.
