Younger adults stand out as an audience for the campaigns’ social media activity. While all age groups rely on social media communications more than email or websites, young adults do so in the largest numbers. Nearly four-in-ten (37%) of those ages 18 to 29 turn to candidates’ social media accounts, compared with 28% of those ages 30 to 49, 19% of those ages 50 to 64, and 11% of those 65+. Younger adults also are more likely to turn to candidate websites, although the difference is not as prominent.
