In both countries, confidence in Trump and feelings toward the U.S. are related to the sentiment of words chosen. Those with no confidence in Trump are at least twice as likely as those who express confidence in him to use a negative word to describe the U.S. (60% vs. 22% in Canada, 33% vs. 15% in Mexico). The same goes for views of the U.S.: Those with an unfavorable view of the U.S. are at least twice as those with a favorable view to use a negative word to describe the U.S. (70% vs. 30% in Canada, 44% vs. 13% in Mexico).
