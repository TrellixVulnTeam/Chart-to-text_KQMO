As noted above, there are some indications that Turkish views of the U.S., and of American foreign policy, are turning less negative. For instance, in 2007, 79% opposed U.S.-led efforts to combat terrorism, compared with 55% in 2009.
Similarly, fewer Turks now see the U.S. as a potential military threat. Just over half (54%) say the U.S. could pose a military threat to their country some day â€” a rather striking finding, since Turkey is a longtime NATO ally of the U.S. However, this is down significantly from 76% two years ago.
