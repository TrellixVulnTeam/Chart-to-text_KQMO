The Postal Service also has been trying to reduce its physical footprint, despite resistance from communities and, often, their representatives in Congress. The total number of Postal Service facilities has fallen 9.3% over the past two decades, from more than 38,000 nationwide in 1999 to around 34,600 as of Sept. 30. However, the number of individual mailboxes, P.O. boxes, and other “delivery points” – currently 159.9 million – typically grows by 1 million or more each year, adding to the Postal Service’s challenges.
