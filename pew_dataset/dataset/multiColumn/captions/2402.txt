As is the case in much of the world, relatively few people in Latin America express confidence in Trump’s leadership on the global stage. A median of 77% in Latin America said in the 2017 survey that they have no confidence in the U.S. president to do the right thing regarding world affairs. In 2014, just 42% of people in the same seven countries said they had no confidence in then-U.S. President Barack Obama.
Among 37 countries surveyed globally in 2017, Trump received his lowest ratings on this question in Mexico, where 93% said they have no confidence in the U.S. leader. His proposed wall on the U.S.-Mexico border was also particularly unpopular in the United States’ southern neighbor, where 94% said they disapproved of the project. The border wall was similarly unpopular across the other six Latin American countries surveyed, with a regional median of 83% saying they opposed it.
