Still, Democrats in particular are somewhat more likely today than they were last year to say the term “Democrat” describes them very well: 39% say this today, compared with 33% in March 2016. Another 51% of Democrats say the term describes them fairly well.
Even fewer Republicans (31%) say the term “Republican” applies very well to them; most Republicans (58%) say it describes them fairly well. The share of Republicans who say they are described well by the term is largely unchanged from last year.
