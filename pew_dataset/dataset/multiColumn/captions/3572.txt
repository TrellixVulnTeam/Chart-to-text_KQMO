Clinton and Trump supporters also have widely diverging views of scientists who study climate change. About half of Clinton supporters (51%) say climate scientists understand very well whether or not climate change is occurring compared with just 17% of Trump supporters who believe that.
Few voters give climate scientists high marks for understanding the best ways to address climate change. About a third of Clinton supporters (32%) and just one-in-ten Trump supporters (10%) say climate scientists understand the ways to address climate change very well.
