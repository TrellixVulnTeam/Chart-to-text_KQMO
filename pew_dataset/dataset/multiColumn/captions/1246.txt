In many countries outside the European Union, views of the EU have become more favorable in recent years. The share of people with a positive view has significantly increased since 2013 in Ukraine, Israel, the Philippines, Lebanon, Turkey, South Korea, Argentina and Mexico. (The difference in Ukraine may be, in part, a result of changes in sampling after the Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine. For example, Crimea was surveyed in 2014, but was omitted from sampling in 2019 due to security concerns.)
From 2004 to 2013, roughly six-in-ten or more Russians held positive views of the EU. However, attitudes changed dramatically after 2013, with about half of Russians expressing an unfavorable view in 2014. Negative attitudes have persisted through Russian President Vladimir Putinâ€™s third term, the Russian annexation of Crimea and subsequent EU sanctions on Russia in response to that military incursion.
