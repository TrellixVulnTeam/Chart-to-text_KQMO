Actual executions — which, given the many years that typically elapse between sentencing and execution, are something of a lagging indicator — peaked in 1999, when 98 people were put to death. But they too have fallen, to an average of about 43 over the past decade. (So far this year, 14 people have been executed around the country, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.)
