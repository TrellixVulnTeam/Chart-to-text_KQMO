Americans continue to mostly say these long-term shifts are neither good nor bad for the country. However, the share that views the long-term growth of racial and ethnic diversity as good for the U.S. is higher than it was in 2016.
Currently, 64% of U.S. adults say the prospect of a nation in the next 25 to 30 years in which Black Americans, Latinos and Asian Americans make up a majority of the population is neither good nor bad for the country. Nearly a quarter (24%) say this is a good thing, while fewer than half as many (11%) say it is bad, according to a national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted July 27-Aug. 2 among 11,001 adults. (The survey question did not include all racial and ethnic groups, such as Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians and Alaska Natives, or multiracial Americans, in its wording about the nation’s future diversity.)
While these views have changed little since 2018, the public expresses more positive – and less negative – views of the long-term rise in racial and ethnic diversity than it did four years ago, during the last presidential campaign. Since then, the share saying a majority Black, Hispanic and Asian population is a good thing has increased by 10 percentage points, while there has been a comparable decline (11 points) in the share saying it is bad thing.
