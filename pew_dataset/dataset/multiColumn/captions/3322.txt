While young Hispanics are furthest from the 2020 goal, there are large gaps between U.S.-born and foreign-born Hispanics. U.S.-born Hispanics are twice as likely as their foreign-born counterparts to have completed at least an associate degree (34% vs. 17%). In fact, the attainment rate of young U.S.-born Hispanics is on par with that of young blacks (35%). Itâ€™s important to note that many young foreign-born Hispanics have recently arrived in the U.S. from countries with lower average levels of education than the U.S.
Conversely, young foreign-born Asians are more likely than their U.S.-born counterparts to have completed at least an associate degree. This is largely due to the fact that many of these young Asian immigrants hail from nations that have higher educational attainment levels than the U.S. overall.
