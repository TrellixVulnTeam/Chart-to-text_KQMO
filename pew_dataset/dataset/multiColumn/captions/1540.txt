Eight-in-ten adults in Denmark and three-in-four in Austria (76%), for example, say they pay the church tax â€“ responses that indicate a willingness to make the payment, even though the actual shares of Danes and Austrians who pay church taxes may be lower. In both countries, more than half of respondents (76% in Denmark and 56% in Austria) also say religion should be kept separate from government policies.
