A new national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted July 24-27 among 1,005 adults, finds that compared with three months ago, the public is more likely to believe that the events in Russia and Ukraine are important to U.S. interests. About a week after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over Ukraine, 48% say events in the region are very important to the United States, up 17 points from April (31%).
