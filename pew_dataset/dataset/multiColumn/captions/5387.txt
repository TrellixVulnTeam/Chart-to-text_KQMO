For all journalism jobs, the Indiana research shows that the median income for women was $44,342 in 2012 or 83% of what a male journalist brought home ($53,600). This pay gap has barely changed in the last two decades—it was 81% in 2001 and 1991. The numbers do represent something of an improvement from 1970 when women only made 64% of a male journalist’s median salary, or from 1981 when women earned 71 cents for every dollar paid to men. A Pew Research Center analysis of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found that median hourly earnings for all women in 2012 amount to 84% of what a man makes, which is on par with Indiana’s findings for journalists.
