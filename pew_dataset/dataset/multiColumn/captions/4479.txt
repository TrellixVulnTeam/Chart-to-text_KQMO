Most Do Not Think Military Campaign Is Going Well. In the new poll, just 30% say the U.S. military campaign against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria is going very well or fairly well. About twice as many (62%) say it is going not too well or not at all well. The share giving the military campaign a positive assessment has dipped six points (from 36%) since February.
