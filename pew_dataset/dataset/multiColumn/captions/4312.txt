One area where there were significant differences was survey items relating to technology. The nine out of 406 survey items that have a difference of at least 5 percentage points between the full sample and the Web sample are related to internet or technology use. There is a 13-point difference in daily internet use between the Web-only sample (82%) and of the total sample (69%). About eight-in-ten of Americans in the Web-only sample said they had sent email or texts to friends or family the day before, compared with about seven-in-ten in the total sample. Fully 90% in the Web-only sample own a desktop or laptop, compared with 80% in the total sample.
