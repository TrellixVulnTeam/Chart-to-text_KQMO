Among whites there is also a gender gap on views of workplace diversity: While 27% of white women say a growing emphasis on diversity has helped them in their job or career, only 19% of white men say the same. Similarly, 37% of white women, compared with 20% of white men, say womenâ€™s increased labor force participation has been beneficial for their own job or career. White women who are college graduates are particularly likely to see more women in the workforce as helpful: Half say this has had a positive impact on their job or career, while 27% of those without a college degree say the same.
When it comes to the growing emphasis on workplace diversity, blacks and Hispanics are about twice as likely as whites to say this has helped their job or career (45% and 43% respectively vs. 23%). Among whites, these views vary by education: 31% of white college graduates say this has helped them personally, compared with 17% of non-college whites.
