In seven of 11 developed nations we surveyed this spring – from the U.S. and Canada to Germany and South Korea – women are more likely to consider climate change a serious problem, be concerned it will harm them personally and say that major lifestyle changes are needed to solve the problem.
For example, when asked how serious a problem climate change is, women in the U.S. are significantly more likely than American men (by a margin of 17 percentage points) to say it’s a somewhat or very serious problem. Canadian and Australian women’s concern also outweighs that of men in their respective countries, by 13 points and 12 points, respectively.
The gender disparity also occurs in views of personal harm caused by climate change. American women again differ the most from their male counterparts – 69% of women are concerned it will harm them personally, while fewer than half of men (48%) express this view. Women are more concerned than men in many of the other countries surveyed, including double-digit gender imbalances in Germany (+15 points) and Canada (+14).
On trusting technology alone to solve climate change versus changing personal habits, American, Canadian, British and Australian women in particular are more likely than men to think that people will have to make major lifestyle changes to reduce climate change’s effects. Double-digit differences on this question also appear in Spain, South Korea and Germany.
