Americans believe automation will likely disrupt a number of professions, but fewer foresee their own jobs being at risk. In a survey conducted in May, a majority of U.S. adults said it is at least somewhat likely that jobs such as fast food worker (77%) and insurance claims processor (65%) will be mostly performed by machines in their lifetime, while around half expected the same to be true of jobs such as software engineer and legal clerk. On the other hand, only three-in-ten workers said itâ€™s at least somewhat likely that their own jobs will be mostly done by robots or computers during their lifetimes, including just 7% who said this is very likely.
