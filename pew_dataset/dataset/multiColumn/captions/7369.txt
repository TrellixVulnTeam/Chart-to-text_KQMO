Beyond the campaign, two news stories drew large audiences last week. Nearly one-in-three Americans (29%) paid very close attention to the U.S. Department of Agricultureâ€™s recall of over 100 million pounds of frozen beef. Attention to this story was on par with other recent product recalls such as those affecting Chinese toys and other products last summer and fall and contaminated pet food last spring. Roughly one-in-ten (11%) said this was the single news story they followed more closely than any other last week.
