The survey finds that, as has been the case since 2002, the Republican Party has a sizable advantage over the Democrats on terrorism: 46% of the public says the Republican Party can do better in dealing with the terrorist threat at home, compared with 34% who favor the Democrats.
Republicans hold a narrower, six-point edge (43% to 37%) as the party better able to reflect peopleâ€™s views about gun control. The GOP had an even wider lead on this issue in July (48% to 36%).
Neither party has a significant advantage on the economy or immigration, while the Democratic Party holds wide leads over the GOP on both climate change (46% to 32%) and the environment (53% to 30%).
