Among the activities tested among online users, socializing, either with friends or family or by utilizing social networks, is the most popular choice. Meanwhile, getting information, such as political news, health advice or government services, is in the second tier of internet use, but still widespread. Commerce and career activities such as looking for a job, making or receiving payments, buying products and taking an online class are less common.
