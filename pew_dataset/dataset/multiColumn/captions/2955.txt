Growing shares of Americans – especially those who are lower-income – rely on smartphones to access the internet. Overall, 12% of U.S. adults were “smartphone-only” internet users in 2016 – meaning they owned a smartphone but did not have broadband internet at home. This represents an increase from 8% in 2013. Reliance on smartphones to go online varies greatly by income. One-in-five adults whose annual household income falls below $30,000 are smartphone-only internet users, compared with only 4% of those living in households earning $100,000 or more.
