The trend toward increased support for gay marriage is evident across all regions. In each, the percentage that currently favors allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally is far higher than it was a decade ago.
Attitudes toward gay marriage in the South are comparable to where the country as a whole was a decade ago. In the states ranging from Kentucky to Texas, 35% now support same-sex marriage. That is comparable to the 33% that said this nationwide in 2003.
At the same time, the proportion nationwide that currently favors allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally matches the percentage that said this in New England a decade ago (both 48%).
