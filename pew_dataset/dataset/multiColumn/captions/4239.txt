Positive sentiment towards President Erdogan has declined significantly in the past year. Before the first round of parliamentary elections in June, only 39% of Turks had a favorable view of Erdogan. About half (51%) held a negative view of the former prime minister and de facto ruler of the country. That compares with last year when 51% of Turks had a positive view of Erdogan and in 2013 when he had 62% support.
