Parents generally get positive ratings from teens about their efforts to tackle online harassment and bullying. Roughly six-in-ten teens (59%) say parents are doing an excellent or good job at addressing cyberbullying â€“ a notably positive assessment, considering how teens rate other groups measured in this survey. Teens are far less likely to rate the anti-bullying efforts of elected officials, social media companies and teachers positively.
