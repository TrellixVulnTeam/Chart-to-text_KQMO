Americans largely support the use of drones to target extremists in countries like Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia. A March survey found 61% overall supported the strikes while 30% disapproved. The drone program had bipartisan support â€“ majorities of Republicans (69%), Democrats (59%) and independents (60%) approved.
However, the drone operations are widely unpopular in the rest of the world. In 31 of 39 countries surveyed last spring, at least half of the publics disapproved of the attacks. At least three-in-four held this view in 15 of the countries. Aside from the U.S., the only countries where majorities supported the drone strikes were Israel (64%) and Kenya (56%). In Pakistan, they were opposed by 68% of the public.
