It’s worth noting that birth rate figures only include live births. In 2013, the estimated teen pregnancy rate – which reflects not only live births, but also miscarriages, stillbirths and abortions – was 43.4 pregnancies per 1,000 females ages 15 to 19. This marks a steep decline, especially since 1990, when the pregnancy rate among teens peaked at 117.6.
The abortion rate among 15- to 19-year-old girls and women has also been declining, from 44.0 per 1,000 in 1988 to 10.6 in 2013. Of the roughly 450,000 pregnancies among teens in 2013, about 61% are estimated to have ended in live births, 24% in abortions and 15% in miscarriages or stillbirths.
