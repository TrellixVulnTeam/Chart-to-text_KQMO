On one hand, a majority of Americans feel that these jobs are good options for people who want a flexible work schedule (68%) or for older adults who donâ€™t want to work full time any more (54%). On the other hand, around one-in-five feel that these jobs place too much financial burden on workers (21%) and let companies take advantage of workers (23%), while just 16% feel that this type of work offers jobs that people can build careers out of.
