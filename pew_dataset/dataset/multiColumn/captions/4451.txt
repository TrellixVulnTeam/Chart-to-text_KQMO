Overall, women are more likely to name a family member (including other family members, such as siblings) as one of the three people they talk with most about politics (85%, vs. 76% of men). On the other hand, men are more likely to name non-family members (79%, vs. 70% of women), a difference that holds true across all age groups. For example, young men ages 18-29 are far more likely than their female counterparts to think of one of their friends as a main discussion partner (72% vs. 58%).
