While the media focused intently last week on the escalating debate over U.S. policy in Iraq, the public took a typical summer hiatus from the major news stories of the week. The Iraq war, rather than the policy debate, was the news story the public focused on most closely, but even attention to the war was down substantially from previous weeks. A quarter of the public paid very close attention to events in Iraq, down from 36% the week before and the lowest level recorded this year. Roughly the same proportion (24%) listed the war as the single news story they followed more closely than any other. Interest in the other ongoing news stories — the Iraq policy debate and the 2008 presidential campaign — was also somewhat lower than in previous weeks.
