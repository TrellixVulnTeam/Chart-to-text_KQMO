In the wake of yet another breakdown in the Middle East peace process, publics in the region have little faith that a way can be found for Israel and an independent Palestinian state to coexist peacefully with each other. Majorities or pluralities in countries across the region voice the view that peaceful coexistence is not possible. And such pessimism is on the rise among many Middle Eastern publics.
But grave doubts about an Israeli-Palestinian modus vivendi are also expressed by a significant majority of Tunisians (71%), the Palestinians themselves (63%) and Turks (62%). Among Palestinians, 68% of those living in Gaza and 60% living on the West Bank say peaceful accommodation is impossible. Only 16% of Palestinians in the Palestinian territories see Israel and a Palestinian state coexisting peacefully.
