Revelations in September 2013 that the U.S. government had monitored the private communications of Brazil’s President Dilma Rousseff had strained relations between the two countries. But Rousseff’s arrival in the U.S. this week for a meeting with President Barack Obama comes at a time when public sentiment about the U.S. in Brazil has almost fully returned to the overwhelmingly positive opinions held before the surveillance controversy.
Nearly three-quarters of Brazilians (73%) have a favorable view of the U.S. – the highest level of approval among the Latin American countries surveyed, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. Young people ages 18-29 (84%) and those with more education (80%) are especially likely to express pro-American sentiments. In our 2013 survey, fielded before the Edward Snowden revelations, 73% of Brazilians also had a positive view of the U.S. But ratings dropped 8 percentage points in 2014 to 65% before rebounding this year.
