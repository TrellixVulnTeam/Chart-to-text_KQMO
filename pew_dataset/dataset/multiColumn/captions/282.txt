In a new survey, fewer than a quarter of registered voters express “warm” or positive views of McConnell, the Senate majority leader. When asked to rate the two senators on a “feeling thermometer” – in which 100 represents the warmest rating and 0 the coldest – 23% of voters say they feel very or somewhat warmly toward McConnell. Just 13% give him a very warm rating of 76 or more on the scale.
