Americans remain divided on the issue of encryption: 46% believe that the government should be able to access encrypted communications when investigating crimes, while 44% believe that technology companies should be able to use encryption tools that are unbreakable even to law enforcement. Democrats and younger adults tend to express greater support for strong encryption, while Republicans tend to express greater support for encryption protocols that can be accessed by law enforcement in the context of criminal investigations.
