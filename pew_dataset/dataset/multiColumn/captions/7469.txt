In other news this week, aside from the Vick story, the situation in Iraq and the devastating floods in the Midwest were the public’s most closely followed news stories. A third of Americans (34%) paid very close attention to the situation in Iraq and 17% listed this as their most closely followed news story. Roughly a quarter (27%) followed the floods very closely and 17% listed this as their most closely followed story. Interest in the floods was particularly high in those states that were directly affected — 41% of Midwesterners followed the story very closely.
Though Hurricane Dean received slightly more press coverage than the Midwest floods, the public paid closer attention to the floods. Fewer than one-in-five (18%) followed news about the hurricane very closely, 11% listed this as their top news story of the week. Hurricanes that impact the U.S. directly invariably draw a larger audience than do storms, such as Dean, that hit the Caribbean or Mexico.
The Iraq policy debate, the most heavily-covered news story of the week, drew the very close attention of 25% of the public. While 12% of the national newshole was devoted to this story, only 8% of the public said this was the story they followed most closely.
