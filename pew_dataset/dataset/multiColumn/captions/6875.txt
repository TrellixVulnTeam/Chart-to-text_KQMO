When it comes to the economy, the public sees little change in the tenor of recent news. Two-thirds (66%) say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy, matching the numbers from early April and early March.
Public views about the mix of economic news have changed little since the start of 2010. Currently, 66% say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy, about the same as the 65% recorded Jan. 8-11. About three-in-ten (29%) say they are hearing mostly bad news, while 4% say they are hearing mostly good news. Those numbers also are little changed this year.
