Fully 85% of Americans have heard or read about the virus – 38% say they have heard or read “a lot” and 48% say they have read “a little” about it. Those who have paid the most attention are also more likely than others to believe the virus is a threat to the population as a whole, to pregnant women and to themselves.
The level of attention and concern about Zika could evolve if new outbreaks occur and news coverage of the virus potentially increases heading into the Summer Olympics Games in Brazil. By the height of the most-recent major Ebola outbreak in Africa in the fall of 2014, Pew Research Center surveys found that 98% of Americans had heard at least a little about the Ebola problem. Some 79% had heard a lot about the Ebola situation at that time, compared with the 38% who say they have heard a lot about the Zika problem now.
