While divided in their overall views, the public sees a more prominent role for the U.S. today than it did a few years ago. In 2016, 46% said the U.S. played a less important and powerful role as a world leader than it did 10 years prior; smaller shares said its global role was as important (31%) or more important (21%) than it was a decade before.
Republicans have become much more likely to say the U.S. plays a more important role as a world leader today than in the past. Overall, 45% say the United States’ global role is more important today than it was a decade ago; in 2016, just 15% of Republicans said this. This shift has been accompanied by a sharp decline in the share of Republicans who think the country’s global role is less important than a decade ago; just 19% say this today, compared with 65% who said this in 2016.
Views among Democrats have moved in the opposite direction. Nearly half (49%) think the U.S. plays a less important leadership role today than it did 10 years ago, up from 29% who said this in 2016. Three-in-ten Democrats say the U.S. global leadership role is about as important as it was 10 years ago and 19% think it is more important; both shares are somewhat lower than they were in 2016.
