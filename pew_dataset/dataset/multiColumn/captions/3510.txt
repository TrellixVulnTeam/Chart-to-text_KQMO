As Election Day nears, more Republicans feel favorably toward their party. As in past cycles, Republicansâ€™ ratings of their own party have grown more favorable as the campaign nears its end. About eight-in-ten Republicans (82%) now say they have a favorable view of the GOP. This positive outlook is up from earlier this year, when the share who rated the party favorably dipped. In June, 69% of Republicans had a favorable opinion, while 28% rated the GOP unfavorably.
