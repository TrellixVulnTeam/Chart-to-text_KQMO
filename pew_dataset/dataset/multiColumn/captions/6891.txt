Four-in-ten Americans say they very closely followed news about the new health care reform law last week; just as many say they followed news about the economy very closely. However, substantially more people say news about the health care law is the story they followed most closely: 33% say this about health care, while 18% say it about the economy.
Health care consumed almost 40% of the newshole in mid-to-late March, but coverage dropped off dramatically after the legislation became law: For the week that included the day Obama signed the bill (March 22-28), the health care debate itself accounted for 38% of coverage, according to PEJ. The following week, it accounted for 9% of coverage.
