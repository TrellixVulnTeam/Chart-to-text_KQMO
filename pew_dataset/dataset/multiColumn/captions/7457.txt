Interest in the 2008 presidential campaign remained steady last week: 21% of the public followed campaign news very closely and 12% listed this as their most closely followed story. As has been the case throughout most of the year, Democrats paid closer attention to the campaign than did Republicans. This past week, the gap was particularly large with 30% of Democrats and 13% of Republicans paying very close attention to campaign news.
