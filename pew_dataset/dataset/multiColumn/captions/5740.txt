Social media has grown as a source for news: 19% of Americans saw news on a social network “yesterday” in 2012, more than double the 9% who had done so in 2010. Those in their 30s (30%) are nearly as likely as those 18-24 (34%) to say they saw news or news headlines on Facebook or another social networking site yesterday.
