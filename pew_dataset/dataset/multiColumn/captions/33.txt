Outlets have several options for reaching their consumers, including apps, newsletters, podcasts and aggregation platforms like Apple News or Flipboard. The use of those different tools varies across digital-native news outlets. In a Pew Research Center audit of 37 outlets conducted in mid-2019, just under half of these highest-traffic digital-native news outlets (46%) have apps for at least one of the two main mobile platforms (iOS and Android). This is down from the 2018 figure of 57%, which drew from a somewhat different group of sites. Those outlets that do have apps tend to offer them for both platforms: About four-in-ten (41%) have apps for both platforms, while 5% have just an iOS app (down from 23% among the 2018 group of sites). None only offer an Android app.
