When it comes to childrenâ€™s living arrangements, there are modest differences across community type, which are linked to the variation in both marriage and births outside of marriage. For example, in the suburbs, where marriage is relatively common and nonmarital births are relatively low, 71% of children live with two married parents. This is slightly higher than the 66% of children in urban areas living with two married parents, and similar to the 68% of rural children who live with two married parents.
