The average U.S. adult is able to answer slightly fewer than half of the religious knowledge questions correctly (14.2 of the 32). But the survey finds that Americansâ€™ level of knowledge varies based on who is answering the questions.
Educational attainment is strongly associated with religious knowledge. College graduates get an average of 18.2 out of 32 religious knowledge questions right, including 18% who answer 25 or more correctly. Within this group, people who have a postgraduate degree do especially well, averaging 19.3 out of 32 questions correct, including one-quarter who answer at least 25 questions right (24%). By comparison, those who have a high school diploma or less education get 11.0 questions right, on average.
