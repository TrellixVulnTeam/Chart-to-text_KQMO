Here’s one example: Given the considerable attention that China has received for its investments in Africa, how do people in key African nations see China and its leadership? As of 2019, public opinion toward China runs more positive than negative in three sub-Saharan African countries surveyed by the Center: Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa. Majorities in Nigeria and Kenya have a positive impression of China (70% and 58%, respectively), while South Africans are a bit more divided (46% favorable, 35% unfavorable).
The pattern is similar when it comes to views of China’s leader, President Xi Jinping. Majorities in Nigeria and Kenya express confidence in Xi to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs (61% and 58%, respectively). Among people in South Africa, 52% have confidence in Xi while 29% do not.
