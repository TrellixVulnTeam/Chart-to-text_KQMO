When Americans are asked why more students don’t pursue a degree in science, technology, engineering or math (STEM), they are most likely to point to the difficulty of these subjects, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. About half of adults (52%) say the main reason young people don’t pursue STEM degrees is they think these subjects are too hard.
In the new Center survey, Americans with a college degree or more education are more likely than those with less education to say the main reason is that young people think STEM subjects are too hard (63% vs. 46%). Those without a college degree are about twice as likely as college graduates to say the main reason young people don’t pursue a degree in a STEM field is that they think these subjects are not useful for their careers (27% vs. 13%).
