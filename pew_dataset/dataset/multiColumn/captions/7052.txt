The economy remains the most frequently mentioned problem facing the nation, but an increasing proportion of Americans cite health care. Currently, 55% mention the economy in general or one of several specific economic problems, such as unemployment or the financial crisis. In February, 80% mentioned the economy, the highest percentage in more than 20 years of Pew’s surveys.
Meanwhile, mentions of health care as the top national problem have risen from just 3% in February to 20% today. The last time health care was cited this often was June 1994, during the congressional debate over health care reform in Bill Clinton’s first term. There is little difference in the percentage of Democrats (26%) and Republicans (20%) citing health care as an important national problem.
