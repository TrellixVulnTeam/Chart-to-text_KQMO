A 59% majority says that everything possible should be done to make it easy for every citizen to vote, while 39% say that citizens should have to prove they really want to vote by registering ahead of time.
The national survey by Pew Research Center finds partisans are sharply divided over the question of how easy it should be for citizens to vote. A large majority of Democrats (84%) say that voting should be made as easy as possible for citizens. By contrast, just 35% of Republicans favor making voting as easy as possible, while 63% say citizens should have to prove they really want to vote by registering ahead of time. Among independents, more say it should be easy for citizens to vote (57%) than say they should have to prove they really want to vote (41%).
