Few in the region express confidence in Chinese President Xi Jinping. Most observers expect Xi to begin his second of two five-year terms at the 19th National Congress. Among China’s neighbors, however, there is limited confidence in him to do the right thing regarding world affairs. A median of 34% across the Asia-Pacific region say they have a lot or some confidence in him, ranging from a high of 53% in the Philippines to a low of 11% in Japan – a country where not even 1% say they have a lot of confidence in him. In India, Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines, Xi ranks behind U.S. President Donald Trump. Notably, however, in two U.S. treaty-allies in the region, Australia and South Korea, people have more confidence in Xi than in Trump.
