Hawaii’s abundance of multiracial people with Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander heritage differs from the makeup of the nation’s overall multiracial population (including adults and children). In the U.S., the multiracial population is more evenly spread among biracial white and black (22%), white and Asian (18%) and white and American Indian (16%).
