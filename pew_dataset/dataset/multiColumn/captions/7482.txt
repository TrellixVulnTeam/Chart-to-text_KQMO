Dramatic events in London and Scotland last week attracted a large news audience. Roughly a third of the public paid very close attention to news that British police had found and defused two car bombs in London, and another 31% followed the story fairly closely. Fully 21% said this was the single news story they followed more closely than any other — making it the most closely followed news story of the week.1 Interest in the attempted bombings did not reach the level of last summer’s major terrorism scare. In August 2006, 54% of the public paid very close attention to news about a foiled plot to blow up planes flying from England to the U.S. using liquid explosives.
A large segment of the public remained focused on the Iraq war last week: 32% followed the situation in Iraq very closely and 19% listed this as their most closely followed story.
The demise of the immigration reform bill was the most heavily covered news story of the week — 12% of the overall newshole was devoted to this story. Roughly a quarter of the public followed the immigration debate very closely and 14% listed it as their most closely followed story. Until last week, roughly equal proportions of Democrats and Republicans were following the immigration debate. However, as the controversial legislation collapsed in the Senate, Republicans paid much closer attention than did Democrats (32% followed very closely vs. 19% of Democrats).
