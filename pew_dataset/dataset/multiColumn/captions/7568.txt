Bush Approval: Down on Iraq, Up on Economy
While George W. Bushâ€™s job approval rating overall has held relatively steady in recent months, the public has become significantly more critical of his handling of Iraq. Currently, just 23% approve of how Bush is handling the situation in Iraq, down from 32% in August, and 36% a year ago in December 2005. Meanwhile, disapproval has spiked up to 71% from 61% in August and 58% last December.
