The Pew survey found that British Muslims have a stronger Islamic identity than do Muslims elsewhere in Europe. Fully eight-in-ten (81%) British Muslims think of themselves as Muslims first rather than as British. In France just 46% consider themselves as Muslims first. Primary identification as Muslim is higher in Spain (69%) and Germany (66%) â€“ but still well below what it is in Britain.
