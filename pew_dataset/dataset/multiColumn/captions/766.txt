Americans widely support the “right to be forgotten,” allowing people to remove personal information about themselves from public online searches or databases. When the Center asked Americans in June 2019 about medical data specifically, about seven-in-ten U.S. adults (69%) said all Americans should have the right to have medical data collected by a health provider permanently deleted by the people or organizations who have that information.
White adults, older Americans and those with higher levels of educational attainment and household incomes were more likely to say all Americans should have the right to have this information permanently deleted. For example, 77% of those with a college education or more said this should be a right for all Americans, compared with smaller shares of those with some college education (70%) or a high school diploma or less (61%).
