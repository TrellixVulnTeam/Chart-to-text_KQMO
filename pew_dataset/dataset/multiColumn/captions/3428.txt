U.S. Hindus have 15.7 years of schooling, compared with 12.7 years of schooling, on average, among Christians, the majority religious group in the U.S. In some cases, this difference in attainment between religious minorities and majorities is because members of the minority religious groups were selected under immigration policies favoring highly skilled applicants. In addition, it is often the well-educated who manage to overcome the financial and logistical challenges to successfully settling in another, far-off country.
