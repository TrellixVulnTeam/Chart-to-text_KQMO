As part of a survey to understand customer satisfaction among search engine users, comScore asked participants which search attributes are most important to them and how the search engines they use most often rated on each of these attributes. The survey found that while users’ overall satisfaction levels with search engines are relatively high, there are significant gaps between respondents’ most important attributes and the perceived performance of search engines in these areas. For example, 91% of respondents rated “Returns results that match your needs” as either important or very important, but only 66% reported that this statement describes their favorite engines. The biggest gap between attribute importance and the extent to which the search engines are perceived to deliver is “Knowing that personal information will not be shared without permission.” Fully 85% of users rate this as an important attribute, but only 55% believe search engines deliver.
