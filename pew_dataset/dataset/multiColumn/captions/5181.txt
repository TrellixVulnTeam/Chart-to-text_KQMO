A 2013 poll we conducted of 40 countries showed that, globally, Indians are among the most likely to say that Islamic extremist groups pose a major threat to their country. Two-in-three Indians said that Islamic extremist groups are a major security concern. Worries about Islamic extremist groups were about the same in Senegal, where 67% said Islamic extremist groups are a major threat. Only in Italy (74%), France (71%) and Lebanon (70%) did a slightly higher proportion of adults share the view that Islamic extremist groups are a serious national threat.
