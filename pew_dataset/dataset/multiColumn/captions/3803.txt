At this point in the campaign, Clinton receives slightly greater support from Democrats and Democratic leaners (91%) than Trump receives from Republicans and Republican leaners (85%) in a general election matchup.
In part, this reflects the fact that Clinton does somewhat better among Democrats who did not support her in the primary than Trump does among Republicans who did not support him in the primary.
Among Republicans, 77% of those who preferred another candidate in the GOP primary say they would vote for Trump over Clinton. A somewhat larger percentage of Democrats who preferred Sanders in the Democratic primary (85%) say they would vote for Clinton over Trump.
