The most active 10% of adult Twitter users in the U.S. produce 80% of all tweets sent by these users. The median adult user of the platform tweets just twice a month, but a small group tweets much more frequently, according to our April study. There was an even starker pattern in a follow-up study that looked specifically at tweets about national politics. In that study, 97% of tweets that were created by U.S. adults and mentioned national politics came from just 10% of users.
