Almost all of the quiz-takers (94%) say they have a library card, compared with 61% of the general population, and 87% have visited a library in the past year. Even more notably, 88% have used a public library website in the past year—almost three times the rate of the Americans population overall (30%). This is probably due to a basic self-selection bias: In general, people who are highly engaged with libraries are more likely to take a “library user type” quiz in the first place.
