Political identity is a key element of many of our findings related to U.S. politics, and partisanship is the predominant divide seen in the public’s views on political issues. But not everyone in the U.S. identifies with one of the two main political parties. In fact, self-identified independents make up about 38% of U.S. adults, counting independents who “lean” toward one party or the other.
For a report on politically independent Americans, we wanted to visualize two things: how large a share of the population considers itself independent and how few within that group are “true” independents – that is, adults who don’t lean toward either party.
