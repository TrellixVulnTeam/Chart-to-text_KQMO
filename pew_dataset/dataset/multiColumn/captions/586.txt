Most U.S. adults (63%) say a major reason for higher COVID-19 hospitalization rates among Black people is that they are more likely to live in densely populated areas. Smaller but still substantial shares point to Black people being more likely to have other health conditions that put them at risk (52%), that they are less likely to have access to adequate health care (49%) and that they are more likely to work in industries that require contact with the public (45%).
Black Americans are particularly likely to see some of these explanations as major reasons why Black people have been hospitalized at higher rates than other racial or ethnic groups. For example, about two-thirds of Black adults (66%) say a major reason is that Black people are more likely to have other health conditions that put them at risk, compared with about half or fewer Asian (52%), white (51%) and Hispanic adults (45%). And while a majority of Black (71%) and Asian (61%) Americans say a major reason for the higher hospitalization rates is that Black people have less access to adequate health care, the share falls to 45% among both white and Hispanic Americans.
