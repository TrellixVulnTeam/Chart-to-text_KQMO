When the panel began, nearly two-thirds of respondents took their surveys on a PC or laptop. That share declined quickly through 2014 and 2015 and has continued to gradually decline since then. In a November 2018 wave of the panel, just over half of the interviews were conducted on a smartphone, while 39% used a PC or laptop. About 8% took the survey on a tablet computer, a figure that has remained fairly stable since the panel was created.
