In the Philippines, South Korea and Japan, Obama’s efforts to deepen security and economic ties with the U.S. are likely to find a receptive audience. When asked which is more important, having strong ties with China or the U.S., most of those surveyed in these three countries said the latter. In contrast, half of Malaysians volunteered that it’s equally important to maintain strong ties with both major powers.
America’s overall ratings are significantly higher than China’s in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. This is especially true in Japan, where 69% had a favorable view of the U.S., while only 5% said the same about China. Ratings for the U.S. were overwhelmingly positive in the Philippines and South Korea, while China received mixed reviews in both countries. Malaysia is again the exception: A narrow majority of Malaysians had a favorable opinion of the U.S., but roughly eight-in-ten (81%) gave China a positive rating.
