By comparison, the Washington Post/ABC News survey described the situation as follows: The AP reported classified information about U.S. anti-terrorism efforts and prosecutors have obtained AP’s phone records through a court order. Do you think this action by federal prosecutors is or is not justified? The survey found substantially more saying the actions were justified, by a 52%-33% margin. The difference is likely attributable to three differences in the way the surveys described the situation. First, Pew Research referred to the decision to subpoena phone records while the WP/ABC survey said the records were obtained… through a court order, which may make the actions seem more legitimate by highlighting a court’s involvement. Second, what Pew Research described as classified information the WP/ABC poll described as classified information about U.S. anti-terrorism efforts; past research suggests the public is willing to accept broader government actions in the defense against terrorism. Third, Pew Research mentioned the Justice Department, while WP/ABC mentioned federal prosecutors. It is likely that the DOJ, as a more political institution associated with the administration, is viewed less favorably than are prosecutors. All three of these differences likely contribute to the remarkably different survey results.
