Pew Research Center estimates that 8% of all working, residential cellphones in the U.S. are erroneously flagged inactive, which is several points higher than a previous study reported.3 Taken together with the fact that 91% of U.S. adults own a cellphone, the result is a 7-percentage-point reduction in sample coverage of U.S. adults. For a national cellphone sample, this reduces the estimated net coverage rate of U.S. adults from about 91% to 83%.
These net rates are based on estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâ€™s January to June 2015 National Health Interview Survey that 3% of adults have no telephone and another 6% have a landline but no cellphone. For national RDD surveys of adults, the inclusion of a landline sample substantially mitigates the reduction in coverage from excluding flagged-inactive numbers (from 97% coverage to 93%, rather than 83%).
While excluding flagged-inactive cellphones reduces the survey coverage rate and disproportionately excludes hard-to-reach demographic groups, it does not appear to have a meaningful effect on bias, at least for public opinion surveys. Adults with cellphones erroneously flagged as inactive do differ systematically on several dimensions from those with flagged-active cellphones, as described above, but they constitute too small a fraction of the population to meaningfully move estimates. In the survey, 2% of all cellphone sample interviews and 1% of the combined (cellphone plus landline) sample interviews were with adults reached on numbers erroneously flagged as inactive using the activity flag.
