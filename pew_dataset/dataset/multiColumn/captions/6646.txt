Both the public and the media focused last week on the increasing violence in Libya, but Americans also closely tracked news about a related concern â€“ the impact the crisis in the Middle East is having on oil prices at home.
About two-in-ten (21%) say they followed news about the rising price of oil more closely than any other major story, according to the latest News Interest Index survey conducted Feb. 24-27 among 1,009 adults. Comparable numbers say they most closely followed news about the situation in Libya (19%) or the budget disputes in Wisconsin and other states between state governments and public employee unions (18%).
