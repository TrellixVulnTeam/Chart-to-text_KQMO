Three-in-ten Americans (31%) followed campaign news very closely and an equal number called the race their most closely followed news story of the week. Democrats were slightly more likely than Republicans to have followed campaign news very closely (39%-31%). Overall interest in campaign news is down somewhat from February and early March. The percentage of Americans following the campaign very closely had been at or near 40% since early February and has started to slip over the past two weeks.
Despite receiving a significantly smaller share of media coverage, the condition of the U.S. economy is of at least as much interest to the American public. More than four-in-ten followed news about the condition of the U.S. economy very closely and 28% listed economic news as their most closely followed story. Republicans and Democrats followed the news in equal numbers, while those earning under $30,000 a year were less likely than higher earners to have followed the story very closely.
In other news, with the 4,000th U.S. military death in Iraq and renewed violence in the country, news coverage of the Iraq war increased last week. The media devoted 12% of its overall coverage to events in Iraq. This is by far the greatest amount of coverage devoted to Iraq in any given week thus far this year. In spite of the increase in coverage, public interest in the war remained steady: 29% followed Iraq news very closely (virtually unchanged from the previous four weeks) and 13% listed the war as the news story they followed most closely last week.
The ongoing NCCA basketball tournament was the top story for 9% of the public and 13% said they followed the story very closely. Unsurprisingly, men (19% very closely) were more than twice as likely as women (8% very closely) to have been following the tournament very closely.
