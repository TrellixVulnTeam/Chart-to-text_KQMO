A recent Pew Research Center survey of LGBT Americans found that among LGBT adults, gay men (72%) are the most likely to have ever attended a pride event, followed by lesbians (61%) and bisexuals (33%). When it comes to more recent attendance, roughly equal shares of gay men (29%) and lesbians (23%) had attended a pride event in the 12 months prior to the survey, compared with just 9% of bisexuals. The survey also found that gay pride events are more likely to be attended by those who say their sexual orientation or gender identity is “extremely” or “very” important to their overall identity (66%), than those who view their sexual orientation as less important to their overall identity (45%). Our survey was conducted from April 11-29, 2013, prior to the beginning of this year’s LGBT pride month.
