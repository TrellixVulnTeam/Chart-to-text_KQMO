The public gave doctors high marks on several specific aspects of trust. Around half of Americans or more said medical doctors always or usually care about their patientsâ€™ best interests (57%), do a good job providing diagnoses and treatment recommendations (49%) and provide fair and accurate information when making recommendations (48%). But notably smaller shares said doctors are transparent about potential conflicts of interest with industry groups (15%) and admit mistakes and take responsibility all or most of the time (12%).
