With their party engaged in the early stages of a battle for the nomination, Republicans are now following election news more closely than are Democrats or independents. Looking at monthly averages, 32% of Republicans followed campaign news very closely each week in September. That drops to 22% among Democrats and 21% among independents.
Republicans followed news about the candidates much more closely this September than they did in September 2007 (32% vs. 18% very closely). On the other hand, Democrats were more attentive four years ago as Clinton and Obama fought for the nomination. In September 2007, nearly three-in-ten Democrats (28%) said they were following news about the candidates very closely, compared with 22% in September 2011. Interest among independents is comparable to four years ago (21% now vs. 18% in 2007).
