Hurricanes Felix and Henriette, that simultaneously struck Central America from the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean, captured less attention than other storms of the recent past. About one-in-seven (14%) followed the storms very closely last week, compared with far greater numbers who followed Hurricane Wilma in November 2005 (34%, very closely) or Hurricane Katrina (70%) in September 2005, both of which impacted Americans more directly.
Questions about the political future of Idaho Sen. Larry Craig following his arrest for disorderly conduct in an airport restroom made him a prominent figure in the news for a second straight week. News about Sen. Craig was followed very closely by 16% of the public, down only slightly from two-in-ten (19%) closely following news about his arrest the week before. A congressional sex scandal in October 2006 involving then-U.S. Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.) who sent inappropriate messages to young people, attracted greater interest: At that time, 26% said they were following news about Foleyâ€™s actions and his subsequent resignation very closely.
German officials last week stopped a terrorist plot by a group of Islamic militants to bomb several locations including Ramstein U.S. military base. One-in-five followed this story very closely and just 6% said it was the story they followed most closely. News about this foiled plot received roughly the same level of public interest as a similar new story in May, when six men were charged with plotting an attack on Fort Dix Army base in New Jersey (19% followed that news very closely).
