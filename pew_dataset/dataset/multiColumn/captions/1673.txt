Opinions about whether congressional Democrats are keeping the promises they made during the campaign are similar to Pelosiâ€™s job approval: 40% say Democrats are keeping their campaign promises, while a somewhat larger share (46%) say Democrats are not keeping their promises.
That is a more positive verdict from the public than congressional Republicans received after their 2014 and 2010 victories, when majorities said they were not keeping campaign promises (65% said this in May 2015, 52% in April 2011). After the Democrats won Congress in 2006, the public was divided on whether they kept their promises (40% said they did, 38% said they did not).
Neither party has come close to the positive views of the GOP after they gained control of Congress in the 1994 midterm. In April 1995, 59% of the public said Republicans were keeping their campaign promises; just 31% said they were not.
