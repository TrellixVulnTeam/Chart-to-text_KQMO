Almost two-thirds of Americans say they are very (18%) or somewhat (47%) confident in the government’s ability to deal with the swine flu; the remaining one third is not too (19%) or not at all (15%) confident in the government’s ability to handle the virus. People are less confident in the media’s ability to accurately report on the swine flu: Just more than half are very confident (17%) or somewhat confident (36%) in the press’ ability to cover swine flu, while 46% have more doubts.
