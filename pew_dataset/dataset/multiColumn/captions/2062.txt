Russians and Americans are both similarly split on the changing nature of American power – but are more likely to say Russia’s international importance is rising. Opinions in both countries are divided over whether the U.S. is playing a more important, equally important or less important role in the world compared with 10 years ago. But there is more agreement that Russia’s importance has increased. Around seven-in-ten Russians (72%) say this, as do 52% of Americans. People in both countries also agree that China plays a more important role in the world today than a decade ago (73% and 72%, respectively).
