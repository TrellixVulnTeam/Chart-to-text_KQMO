Many conservative Republicans have a negative view of scientists’ understanding of climate change. Majorities of conservative Republicans say climate scientists have little or no understanding of the causes of climate change or ways to address it. In comparison, majorities of the other political groups, including moderate and liberal Republicans, say climate scientists understand the causes of climate change and ways to address it very or fairly well.
Climate scientists are not the only ones in whom conservative Republicans have low trust on the issue. Majorities of conservative Republicans say they have “not too much” trust in elected officials, energy industry leaders and the news media – or trust them “not at all” – to provide full and accurate information about the causes of climate change.
