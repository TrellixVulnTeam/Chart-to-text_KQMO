Today, about half of voters (52%) say they have given a lot of thought about the presidential candidates – the highest share at this early point in an election cycle since the question was first asked in the run-up to the 2008 election.
Similar majorities of both Republican and Democratic voters say they have given a lot of thought to the 2020 candidates running for president (55% and 52%, respectively).
Among registered Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters, the shares who say they have given a lot of thought to the candidates is higher than the shares who said this at similar points in the previous three election cycles. Today, about half of Democratic voters say this (52%), compared with smaller shares in 2015 (43%), 2011 (22%) and 2007 (37%).
Republican voters are about as likely to say they’ve thought about the 2020 candidates as they were in September 2015 – when there were over 15 candidates running for the GOP presidential nomination.
