Four years after the recession officially ended, the economic recovery remains a long way off in the view of many Americans.
A new survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted July 17-21 among 1,480 adults, finds that 44% say it will be a long time before the nationâ€™s economy recovers. Smaller percentages say either the economy already is recovering (28%) or will recover soon (26%).
