The war in Iraq continued to attract broad public attention, despite drawing far less news coverage than the Imus flap. Overall, 34% of Americans say they followed news about the situation in Iraq very closely, and 26% cited the war as the story they followed most closely from April 12-16.
News about Imus’s remarks regarding the Rutgers women’s basketball team was the second most closely followed story: 24% say they followed this story very closely, and 20% named it as the story they tracked most closely.
The public paid less attention to the week’s other major stories. Fewer than one-in-ten cited the issue of immigration (8%), the Iraq policy debate (7%), the 2008 presidential campaign (6%), or the Duke lacrosse case (5%) as the story they followed most closely last week.
