As the following charts show, the differences between dial-up and broadband users persist in our October 2002 data, but they are much smaller for dial-up users with 6 or more years of online experience who say they want broadband. This is especially true for information gathering activities. Two in five (41%) of broadband users get news on the Internet on a typical day compared with 35% of experienced dial-up users who want broadband.
