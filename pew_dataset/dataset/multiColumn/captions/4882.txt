U.S. deportations of immigrants reached a record high in 2013.
The Obama administration deported a record 438,421 unauthorized immigrants in fiscal year 2013, continuing a streak of stepped up enforcement that has resulted in more than 2 million deportations since Obama took office, according to Department of Homeland Security data. Up to that point, the current administration deported about as many immigrants in five years as the George W. Bush administration deported in eight years. A survey conducted in February found the public evenly divided over whether the increase in deportations was a good or a bad thing.
