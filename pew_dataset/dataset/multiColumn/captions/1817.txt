A separate survey conducted in June and July last year found wide party gaps in views of gender and leadership. About eight-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners (79%) said there are too few women in high political offices, compared with 33% of Republicans and Republican leaners – a 46-point gap. The gender gap on this question was substantial, with 69% of women overall saying there are too few women in office compared with 48% of men. Among Republicans, gender gaps in views of women in leadership were particularly wide. By 20 percentage points, Republican women were more likely than their male counterparts to say there are too few women in high political offices in the U.S. today. And while most Republican women said it’s easier for men to get these positions, closer to half of GOP men said the same. (There are also party and gender divides in views of women in corporate leadership.)
