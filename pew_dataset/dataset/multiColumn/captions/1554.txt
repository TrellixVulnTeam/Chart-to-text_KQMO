In fiscal 2017, 179,049 high-skilled foreign workers received H-1B visas. As the nation’s biggest temporary employment visa program, H-1B visas accounted for about a quarter (23%) of all temporary visas for employment issued in 2017. In all, more than 1.6 million H-1B visas were issued from fiscal years 2007 to 2017. The denial rate of H-1B visa applications increased in 2019 under the Trump administration. Meanwhile, more H-1B visas went to immigrants with a U.S. master’s degree or higher. The administration has also said it plans to restrict work permits for spouses of H-1B holders.
