Throughout the seven-year history of the health care law, opinions about it have tended to be more negative than positive â€“ or, less frequently, divided. But in February, for the first time, a majority of the public approved of the law.
That remains the case today, with 56% approving of the law. While that is little changed since February, support has jumped 12 percentage points since April 2016 (44%).
