Environmental protection draws more support in principle than when the issue of potential costs is raised. Among the public, 71% said the country “should do whatever it takes to protect the environment,” according to a January-March 2014 survey. But a smaller majority (56%) said “stricter environmental laws and regulations are worth the cost.” Nearly four-in-ten (39%) said tougher environmental laws and regulations cost too many jobs and hurt the economy.
There are sharp partisan divides on these questions. Democrats overwhelmingly, by eight-to-one, said that the country should do whatever it takes to safeguard the environment while Republicans are almost evenly divided. About seven-in-ten (71%) Democrats believe stricter environmental laws are worth the cost compared with just 37% of Republicans. Nearly six-in-ten Republicans (59%) said stricter environmental laws and regulations have a negative economic impact.
