More than three quarters of the public say they heard at least a little last week about the recall of hundreds of millions of eggs after an outbreak of salmonella. Four-in-ten heard a lot about this, while 37% heard a little. Just more than two-in-ten (22%) say they heard nothing at all.
About three-in-ten (31%) say they heard a lot about the verdict in the corruption trial of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. Another 42% say they heard a little about a federal jury convicting Blagojevich on one count of lying to the FBI but deadlocking on the other charges. About a quarter (27%) say they heard nothing at all about this story.
Fewer than two-in-ten (17%) say they heard a lot about Dr. Laura Schlessinger announcing she will end her radio show after controversy over her use of a derogatory racial term. Close to four-in-ten (38%) say they heard a little about this, but 44% say they heard nothing at all.
