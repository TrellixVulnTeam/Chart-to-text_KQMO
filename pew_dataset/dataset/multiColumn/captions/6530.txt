The public expresses far more confidence in President Obama than it does in congressional leaders of both parties when it comes to the debate over the debt ceiling. Nonetheless, only about half of Americans (48%) have even a fair amount of confidence in Obama to do the right thing when it comes to dealing with the debt ceiling, while nearly as many (49%) say they have not too much confidence or no confidence at all in the president on this issue.
Just 33% have a great deal or fair amount of confidence in Boehner to do the right thing in dealing with the debt ceiling, while 30% say the same about McConnell and 26% have at least a fair amount of confidence in Cantor. Ratings for Democratic leaders are equally low â€“ 29% for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and 27% for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.
