Men are more likely than women to say these three trends have hurt them personally. Some 36% of men point to outsourcing as having a detrimental effect on their job or career, compared with 24% of women. Men also are more likely than women to say the growing number of immigrant workers has harmed their careers (26% vs. 17%) and that having more foreign-made products sold in the U.S. has been a negative (24% vs. 15%).
Racial and ethnic differences emerge as well. For example, a quarter of whites and 21% of blacks say the growing number of immigrants has hurt their job or career, compared with just 11% of Hispanics.
Among whites, those without a college degree are far more likely than those with more education to say that increased outsourcing of jobs to other countries (39% vs. 24%) and a rise in imports (30% vs. 13%) have hurt their job or career. When it comes to the impact of immigration, 42% of whites with no college experience say it has hurt them personally; 26% of those with some college and an even smaller share of white college graduates (12%) say the growing number of immigrants has hurt their job or career. (Educational differences among blacks and Hispanics cannot be analyzed due to small sample sizes.)
