The U.S. general public is also supportive of allowing unauthorized immigrants to remain in the country legally. A Pew Research Center/USA TODAY survey from last June found that 71% of U.S. adults said there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in the country legally, if they meet certain requirements (a different survey question than that asked of Hispanics and Asian Americans). Support for legalization crosses party lines—majorities of Democrats (80%) and Republicans (61%) said they support this measure.
The same survey found that most Americans believe legalization should be tied to improved border security—fully 77% said this. But the public was divided when it came to the timing of this link. Some 43% of U.S. adults said legalization should occur only after the effective control of U.S. borders is achieved, but half (49%) said unauthorized immigrants should be allowed to apply for legal status while border improvements are being made.
