A wide gap in presidential preferences emerged in the 2016 election between whites with and without a college degree. Trumpâ€™s margin among whites without a college degree was the largest among any candidate in exit polls since 1980. Two-thirds (67%) of non-college whites backed him, compared with just 28% who supported Clinton.
