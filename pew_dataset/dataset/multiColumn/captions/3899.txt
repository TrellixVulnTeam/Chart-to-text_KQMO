One theory is that the decline in women’s attendance at services – and subsequent narrowing of the attendance gender gap – is connected to changes in women’s labor force participation. In the mid-1970s, three-in-ten U.S. women ages 25 to 64 were working full time in the labor force. Today, just over half of women in that age group work full time, compared with around 70% of men.
Scholars have found that in the U.S. and other predominantly Christian countries, women working in the labor force attend religious services less often than women outside the labor force and show a smaller gender gap with men. However, it should be noted that the fastest increase in women’s full-time employment during this period occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s, during which time the gender gap on religious service attendance actually widened somewhat.
In the following years (mid 1980s through the late 1990s), the share of women working full time continued to increase and women’s worship attendance declined – but it did so for women inside and outside the labor force, and across occupational categories including managers, professionals and retail and service workers.
