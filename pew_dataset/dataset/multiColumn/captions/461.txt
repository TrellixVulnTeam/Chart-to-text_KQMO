The new survey also finds that social media users generally do not find common ground as a result of online discussions about politics. Roughly seven-in-ten users (72%) say that discussing politics on social media with people they disagree with usually leads them to find out they have “less in common politically” than they expected, while 22% report finding out they have “more in common politically” than previously thought.
