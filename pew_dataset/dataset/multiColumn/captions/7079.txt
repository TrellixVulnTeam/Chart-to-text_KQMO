The state of the U.S. economy and the health care debate in Washington shared the position of American’s top story last week. One-in-five named either the economy (21%) or health care (21%) as the news they followed more closely than any other. These two stories also received comparable levels of new coverage according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism: 13% of total news was devoted to the economy and 11% to the debate on reforming health care.
