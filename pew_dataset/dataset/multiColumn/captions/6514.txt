Nearly six-in-ten Americans (58%) say reports about the economy make them feel angry, higher than the 49% that said this in November 2008 as the economic crisis worsened. Much larger numbers of independents and Republicans say this than in 2008; the percentage of Democrats who feel this way is largely unchanged.
Among the public, about four-in-ten say reports about the economy make them feel confused (40%) or scared (39%). A third say the news makes them feel depressed (33%). Those numbers are little changed from three years ago. About three-in-ten (28%) say the reports make them feel optimistic; 69% say they do not make them feel that way. Again, those numbers are little changed since 2008.
