A Pew Research Center spring 2015 survey found that Pakistanis were extremely critical of these terrorist organizations and supported government action to fight extremists. And they were also much more confident in the ability of the Pakistani government, led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, to tackle extremist groups than they were in 2014.
Overall, Pakistanis had a very negative view of the Taliban and the TTP. (The Lahore bombings were carried out by a TTP splinter group, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, and the TTP were also perpetrators of a horrendous massacre in a public army school in Peshawar in late 2014.) In the survey last April, 72% had an unfavorable view of the Taliban umbrella group, while six-in-ten had negative opinions of TTP specifically. About half (53%) of Pakistanis viewed the Afghan Taliban negatively and 47% voiced dislike for al Qaeda.
Most Pakistanis do not have an opinion of Lashkar-e-Taiba, the group that carried out attacks in Mumbai in 2008 and operates in the disputed Kashmir and Jammu area, nor ISIS, but among those who do, sentiments towards these extremist groups are negative. Across all the extremist organizations tested, no more than 15% of Pakistanis showed support for them, with more people in each case not offering an opinion.
