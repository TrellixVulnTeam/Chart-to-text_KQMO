Looking ahead, those changes will become even more pronounced. Based on census data, Pew Research Center projects that the first- and second-generation immigrant segment of the American population will swell to 37% by 2050, compared with 15% back in 1965. This roughly matches the first- and second-generation immigrant percentage of the public at the turn of the 20th century, which was a high point in American immigration. (For updated projections, see the Center’s September 2015 report “Modern Immigration Wave Brings 59 Million to U.S., Driving Population Growth and Change Through 2065.”)
