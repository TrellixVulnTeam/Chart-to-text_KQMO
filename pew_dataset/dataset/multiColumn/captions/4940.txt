However, a recent Pew Research Center survey finds that many people in these nations remain relatively disconnected from politics. Although most vote in elections, few take part in other forms of political participation. For example, across 33 nations surveyed, a median of just 15% say they have participated in a protest and only 9% have signed a petition. Indeed, large numbers say they would never engage in the various forms of participation included in the poll.
Voting is considered the most useful form of participation on the survey: A median of 75% say it is an effective way to influence what government does. No other type of engagement is considered effective by more than 50%, although many do consider as effective attending campaign events, participating in protests and being a member of a political organization. Young people are more likely than their older counterparts to believe that many forms of political participation are effective, and in particular they are often more likely to say protesting is an effective way to influence government.
