For the first time this fall, news about swine flu and the vaccine ranked atop the public’s news agenda. About a third (32%) followed news about the swine flu more closely than any other story. More than four-in-ten (43%) say they paid very close attention to the story, matching a high reached in early May 2009. For the week, interest was strong despite modest media coverage; swine flu filled 5% of the newshole and trailed coverage of other leading stories, including the economy, Afghanistan, and the debate over health care reform.
Second to the news about swine flu, the health care reform debate was the top story for 27% of the public; 40% followed news about the debate very closely. Coverage accounted for 10% of the national newshole.
Reports about the condition of the U.S. economy was the top story for 15% of the public, while 44% say they followed economic news very closely. News about the economy made up 10% of the newshole. Another 6% of coverage was devoted to issues surrounding executive pay and attempts to regulate it. Almost one third of Americans (32%) say they followed this story very closely; it was the top story for 4%.
News about the U.S. military effort in Afghanistan was the most closely followed story of the week for 9% of the public. Close to a third (32%) say they followed Afghanistan news very closely – one of the few times this year that very close interest has topped 30%. The media devoted 13% of coverage to Afghanistan, according to PEJ.
