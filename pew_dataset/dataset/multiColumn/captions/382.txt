Among Republicans, trust in the federal government has increased since the end of Barack Obama’s presidency. A within-administration moving average places the average share of Republicans who trusted the federal government just about always or most of the time at 11% shortly before the 2016 presidential election. The average share of Republicans expressing trust in the federal government increased to 25% in April 2017 and currently stands at 28%.
Today, just 12% of Democrats trust the federal government to do what is right – an historic low. Prior to Trump’s inauguration, the lowest average share of Democrats saying they trusted the government always or most of the time over the more than 60 years since the question was first asked, was 17%, towards the end of George W. Bush’s administration (and prior to the 2008 election) in 2008. More Democrats now say they never trust the federal government to do what is right (17%) than say they can trust it always or most of the time.
