An April 2014 poll found that extensive Washington experience was viewed more negatively than positively, more so among Republicans than Democrats. Republicans (36%) more than Democrats (20%) said they would be less likely to vote for a candidate with Washington experience. That figure rose to 56% for Republicans and Republican leaners who agreed with the Tea Party. Almost half of Republicans and Democrats said it wouldnâ€™t matter to them if a candidate had been an elected official in Washington.
