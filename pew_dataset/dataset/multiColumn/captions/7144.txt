In early March, 66% of Democrats said that the country is headed in the right direction. That compared with 35% of independents and just 11% of Republicans. The partisan differences were much smaller in views of national satisfaction. Slightly more than a quarter of Democrats (27%) said they were satisfied with the way things are going, compared with 20% of independents and 11% of Republicans.
Since Barack Obama was elected in November, Democrats have become increasingly optimistic about the direction of the country. In October, just 4% of Democrats believed the country was heading in the right direction; by December, more than three-in-ten (32%) were optimistic about the country’s direction. In the first NBC/WSJ poll conducted after Obama’s inauguration, two-thirds of Democrats (66%) said the country was headed in the right direction. Over this five-month period, Democratic levels of satisfaction have also increased, but less so (from a low of 2% in October to 27% in early March).
Republican opinion, by contrast, has followed a different pattern. Satisfaction levels among Republicans in early March were about the same as in October, while fewer now say the country is headed in the right direction (11% compared with 21% in October). Independent assessments of the state of the nation have become more positive on both measures since the election.
