Since January there has been a decline in the percentage saying the governmentâ€™s anti-terrorism policies have not gone far enough in protecting the country. At that time, shortly after the failed Christmas Day attack on an airliner, 58% said the government had not gone far enough in protecting the country, more than double the percentage saying it had gone too far in restricting civil liberties (27%). Just two months earlier, in November 2009, 40% said the government had not gone far enough in national security, while nearly as many (36%) said it gone too far in restricting civil liberties.
