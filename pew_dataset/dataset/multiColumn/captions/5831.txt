While public opinion about labor unions may have improved, the news about membership has not. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported earlier this year that overall union membership in 2012 declined to 11.3% of the workforce, from 11.8% in 2011 to 11.3%. The falloff in union membership has been continuous since 1983, the first year for which the BLS says there is comparable data. In that year, the union share of wage and salary workers was 20.1%.
The number of union workers is bolstered by membership of public-sector workers. Their membership rate was 35.9%, five times higher than the share of workers in the private sector (6.6%). But public sector unions are facing their own challenges, ranging from widespread layoffs by state and local governments due to austerity measures forced upon them by the economy, to measures passed in some states, such as Michigan and Wisconsin, cutting back the power of unions representing state workers.
