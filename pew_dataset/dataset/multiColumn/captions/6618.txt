More than eight-in-ten Americans rate press coverage of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan as excellent (43%) or good (42%). Almost as many say the same about coverage of the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords in early January (34% excellent, 40% good).
But when it comes to domestic stories focused on economics and politics, the press gets much lower marks. Just 4% say the news media has done an excellent job covering discussions about how to address the federal budget deficit, 27% say coverage has been good. Nearly two-thirds rate the job the press has done as only fair (40%) or poor (24%).
