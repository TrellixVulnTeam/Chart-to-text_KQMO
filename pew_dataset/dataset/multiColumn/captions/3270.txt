Adults younger than 30 are also much more likely to have a favorable view of unions than of corporations (75% vs. 55%). Those in older age groups have similar opinions of unions and corporations.
Roughly two-thirds (65%) of those with family incomes of $75,000 or more a year have a positive view of corporations, while smaller shares of those with incomes of $30,000-$74,999 (54%) and less than $30,000 (51%) say the same. Households earning less than $30,000 a year also are more favorable toward labor unions than business corporations â€“ the only income group for which this is the case.
