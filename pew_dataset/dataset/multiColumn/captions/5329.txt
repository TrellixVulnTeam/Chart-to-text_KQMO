Given the torpid jobs performance, it comes as little surprise that personal income also has lagged. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, per-capita disposable income (after adjusting for inflation) has grown just 3.2% since mid-2009, to $37,038 as of the first quarter of 2014. In previous recoveries, it was much higher: 11.6% in the first five years of the 2001-07 recovery, and 8.7% in the first five years of the 1990s tech boom.
One metric about the current recovery, however, jumps out: the stock market. The benchmark S&P 500 index has more than doubled over the course of the recovery, by far its largest gain of any of the periods we looked at. The index surpassed its pre-crash high in March 2013, and has gone on since to a series of new record highs. (Of course, that’s not much comfort to the 44% of Americans who say they don’t own stocks.) On another closely tracked measure, the economy regained all of its lost payroll jobs just last month. But even that measure doesn’t take into account the population growth during that period. What the chart doesn’t show is that there are about 15 million more working-age people now than there were in January 2008, but essentially the same number of jobs.
