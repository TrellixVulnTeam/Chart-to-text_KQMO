More users are getting news on both sites than in the past. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of Facebook users and the same share of Twitter users get news via each of the social media sites. This is up substantially from 2013, when about half of each social network’s users (47% for Facebook, 52% for Twitter) reported getting news there. (In both studies, we defined news as “information about events and issues beyond just friends and family.”) This increase in exposure to news among users emerges even as overall usage of each site has remained steady since 2013: 17% of U.S. adults use Twitter and two-thirds (66%) use Facebook. Overall, 10% of all U.S. adults get news on Twitter, and 41% get news on Facebook.
Twitter news users see a somewhat greater mix of topics than Facebook news users. Two-thirds of Twitter news users (67%) regularly see at least six of the 11 news topics we asked about, compared with 57% of Facebook news users. When it comes to the individual topics, four are seen at higher rates among Twitter news users than Facebook news users: sports, business, international news, and national government and politics. News users of both sites are roughly on par with each other for the remaining seven topics.
