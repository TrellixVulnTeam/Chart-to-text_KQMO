Americans continued to express strong interest in news about the death of Osama bin Laden and its ramifications last week, even as news coverage of the story continued to decline.
About a quarter of the public (27%) says they followed reports about the killing of bin Laden and its impact on U.S. relations with Pakistan more closely than any other story, according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey conducted May 19-22 among 1,004 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press.
No one story dominated coverage, but the media devoted 15% of the newshole last week — more than for any other story — to the attempted rape charges brought in New York against Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then the top official at the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Just 2% say this was the news they followed most closely.
The public showed more interest in news about flooding along the Mississippi River and the continuing struggles of the U.S. economy than in news about the former IMF leader, Strauss-Kahn. About two-in-ten (19%) say they followed news about the flooding most closely, while 15% say the economy was their top story.
