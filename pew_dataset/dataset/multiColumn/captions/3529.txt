Many Americans are skeptical that the advantages of economic globalization outweigh the disadvantages: 49% of the public said in an April survey that U.S. involvement in the global economy is bad because it lowers wages and costs jobs. That compares with 44% who said that global economic engagement is good because it opens new markets and creates opportunities for growth. The U.S. public’s divided worldview sharply contrasts with the overwhelming opinion among international relations (IR) scholars that America’s involvement in the world economy is good for the nation.
In the latest of a series of online “snap” polls that ask university-based IR experts their opinion about current policy issues, the Teaching, Research, and International Policy (TRIP) Project early this month found that nearly nine-in-ten IR scholars (86%) see U.S. involvement in the global economy as a positive; just 2% of those in the poll say it is a bad thing. Individuals selected for the TRIP survey must be employed at a political science department or professional school of a U.S. college or university and teach or conduct research on issues that cross international borders.
