Looking ahead, a majority of smart speaker owners also are not seeking more personalization. Different groups of respondents were asked about their desires for the performance of their speakers in the future. In one group, 58% of smart speaker owners say they would not like their speaker to do a better job of taking their interests and preferences into account in the future, compared with 42% who would like their speakers to do a better job taking their interests and preferences into account.
The second group was asked a more detailed question: whether they would like their speakers to do a better job of taking their interests and preferences into account in the future, even if that meant it would need to collect more personal information about them. Only 33% say they would appreciate their interests and preferences being taken more into account, even if it meant more personal data collection, while two-thirds (66%) said they would not like that.
