In regions throughout the world, people who believe the U.S. economy influences their own economy tend to say it is a negative rather than a positive influence. Majorities or pluralities in 14 of the 23 non-U.S. publics surveyed considered U.S. economic influence to be negative. Seventy percent or more of those polled expressed this view in Britain (72%), Germany (72%), Australia (71%), Turkey (70%) and France (70%).
In six nations, 10% or fewer believed the U.S. economy positively affects their economy. Positive assessments were especially rare in several nations where anti-American sentiments have run high in recent years, such as Turkey (only 4% saw the impact as good), Argentina (4%), and Pakistan (6%).
