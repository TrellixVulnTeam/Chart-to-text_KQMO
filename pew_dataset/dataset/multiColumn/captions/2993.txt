The Russian public feels confident about their country’s global standing, according to a new Pew Research Center survey, even as signs of discontent emerge at home. Here are four key findings about how Russians see their nation’s place in the world:
A majority of Russians believe their country is playing a more important role in the world today than it did a decade ago. Other publics with a sense of growing global importance include China and India. In a spring 2016 survey, three-quarters of Chinese and 68% of Indians said their country is more influential compared with a decade ago. Such confidence contrasts with European views, where a median of just 23% across 10 European Union nations felt their country’s global influence was on the rise in 2016.
