The publicâ€™s perceptions of economic news remain mixed and far less positive than earlier in 2010. More than half (55%) say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy; 39% say they are hearing mostly bad news while just 4% say they are hearing mostly good news. Those numbers have changed little since July, when perceptions of economic news took a turn for the worse.
