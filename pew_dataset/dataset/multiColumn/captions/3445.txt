Most Americans think scientists should help make food policy; fewer think food industry leaders should have a major policymaking role. Despite mixed assessments of scientists working on GM food issues, six-in-ten U.S. adults (60%) say scientists should have a major role in policy issues related to GM foods and 28% say they should have a minor role. Similar shares of Americans say that small-farm owners and the general public should have a major role in GM food policy. A smaller share of Americans says that food industry leaders (42%) or elected officials (24%) should have a major role in policy decisions about GM foods.
