Last week, both news coverage and the public’s news interests were dominated by the economic crisis and the backlash against the AIG bonuses. While 35% said that news about the economy was the story they followed most closely, and 29% named AIG as their top story, other news developments were overshadowed. The Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism found that these stories also accounted for most news coverage last week (30% AIG and 23% for other elements of the economy; yielding a total for economic coverage of 53%).
Barack Obama’s appearance on the Tonight Show, where he spoke at length about AIG and the economy, was followed very closely by 16% of the public and was the top story of the week for 4% of Americans. News organizations devoted 2% of the newshole to Obama’s late night appearance.
News about the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to attract modest interest from the public. Last week, one-in-four Americans followed the situation in Iraq very closely and 5% said it was the story they followed more closely than any other. The military effort in Afghanistan also was followed very closely by 24%. This was the top story of the week for 4% of the public. The media devoted 1% of the newshole each to events in Iraq and Afghanistan.
