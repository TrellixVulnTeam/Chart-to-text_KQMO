As Americans look ahead to the presidential election this November, nearly eight-in-ten adults (79%) say it is at least somewhat important for the losing candidate to publicly acknowledge the winner of the election as legitimate, including a majority (54%) who say this is very important. This represents a slight increase since November 2016, when 74% said it was at least somewhat important for a losing candidate to publicly concede.
