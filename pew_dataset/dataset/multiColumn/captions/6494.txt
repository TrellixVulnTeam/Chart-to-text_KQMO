As President Obama prepares to speak to the nation Thursday night about steps to boost job creation, six-in-ten (61%) say they are hearing mostly bad news about the economy. Thatâ€™s down from 67% at the start of August, but still near the high levels recorded in early 2009 near the height of the economic crisis.
Perceptions of the tone of economic news worsened dramatically through much of 2011 as evidence mounted that the recovery had stalled. In May, about a third (35%) said they were hearing mostly bad news about the economy.
That grew to 49% in July and then hit a high for the year so far in August. The numbers moved little between August and September, though in a slightly more positive direction. The number hearing a mix of good and bad news rose from 30% in August to 35%. Still, that is about half the percentage that said this in January (68%). Just 2% say they are hearing mostly good news about the economy.
