While the media’s top story last week was the Iraq policy debate, the public remained focused on the aftermath of the shootings at Virginia Tech University. Fully 43% of Americans followed news about the shootings very closely, and 46% said this was the single news story they followed more closely than any other last week. News coverage of the Virginia Tech shootings fell off dramatically from the previous week: 7% of the news coverage across all media sectors was devoted to the story last week, compared to 51% the week the shootings took place.
The second most closely followed news story, far behind the shootings, was the situation in Iraq — 27% of the public followed events in Iraq very closely and 15% said this was the news story they followed more closely than any other last week. Over the past month, the public has consistently expressed greater interest in the war itself than in the policy debate
