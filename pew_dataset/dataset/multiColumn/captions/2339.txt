The Pew Research Center survey asked Americans whether they think solar geoengineering would make a difference in reducing the effects of climate change and what effects they believe these techniques will have on the environment overall. In contrast to public views on other specific policy proposals, opinion is closely divided – 45% to 52% – over whether solar geoengineering would make a difference in reducing the effects of climate change.
Opinion on this issue is closely aligned with political affiliation. About two-thirds of liberal Democrats (64%) say these techniques would make a difference, while a large majority of conservative Republicans (78%) think they would not.
