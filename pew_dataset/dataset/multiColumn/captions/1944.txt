Americans are closely divided over the health benefits of organic produce. Some 45% of U.S. adults say organic fruits and vegetables are better for you than conventionally grown produce, compared with 51% who say that organic produce is neither better nor worse, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted earlier this year. The share of U.S. adults who say that organic produce is better for one’s health declined by 10 percentage points since a 2016 survey.
However, younger people remain more likely than their older counterparts to say organics are healthier than conventionally grown food. Some 54% of those ages 18 to 29 and 47% of those ages 30 to 49 believe organic fruits and vegetables are generally better for one’s health, compared with 39% of those 65 and older who say the same. As in the 2016 survey, there are no differences among men and women on views of the healthfulness of organic foods.
About four-in-ten U.S. adults (39%) estimate that most (7%) or some (32%) of the food they eat is organic. A majority of this group (68%) believes that organic fruits and vegetables are better for health than conventionally grown options. By comparison, 32% of those who report eating no organic foods or not too much believe that organic produce is better for one’s health.
