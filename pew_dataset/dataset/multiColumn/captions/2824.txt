The rise in online news consumption plays out across demographic groups, especially when looked at by age. The two oldest age groups saw considerable increases in online news use â€“ 10 percentage points for those 65 and older (30% vs. 20% in early 2016) and 6 points among those ages 50 to 64 (35% vs. 29%). The pattern is in line with previous findings that show that recent growth in mobile news was driven by the oldest age groups.
The decline in television as a source of news occurs both among 50- to 64-year-olds and 30- to 49-year-olds. The portion of those ages 50 to 64 who often get news on TV fell from 72% in 2016 to 64% today; for 30- to 49-year-olds, this declined from 45% to 35%. And while 18- to 29-year-olds did not show any significant change in their use of television news from early 2016, it was already substantially lower for this age group than for those 50 and older. Indeed, even in early 2016 this youngest age group was about twice as likely to often get news online as on TV (50% vs. 27%), about as large as the gap seen today (52% vs. 23%).
