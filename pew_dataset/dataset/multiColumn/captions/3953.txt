The proposed border wall is deeply divisive along partisan lines. By nearly two-to-one (63% to 33%), Republicans and GOP leaners favor building a wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border. By contrast, just 13% of Democrats favor building a border wall, while 84% are opposed.
There also are substantial generational and ethnic differences in views of a border wall. Just 20% of Millennials favor building a wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border, which is far lower than the shares of Gen Xers (36%), Boomers (43%) and Silents (47%) who favor this proposal. Whites (43% favor) are more than twice as likely as blacks (13%) and Hispanics (16%) to favor building a border wall.
