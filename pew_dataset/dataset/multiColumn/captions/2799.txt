As Germany expands its international role, the vast majority of the public (81%) is also feeling good about Merkel’s capacity to do the right thing on the world stage.
However, demographic groups differ somewhat in their trust of the chancellor’s international leadership. Germans ages 50 and older have more confidence in Merkel than their younger counterparts and women are more likely to feel this way than men. Despite the chancellor’s center-right political orientation, those on the political left are actually 11 percentage points more likely than those on the right to say they have confidence in Merkel’s ability to deal with foreign affairs.
