Among voters who report attending religious services at least once a month, relatively few say information on political parties or candidates was made available to them in their places of worship (14%), and even fewer say they were encouraged to vote in a particular way by their clergy (5%). Similarly, very few voters overall say they were contacted by religious organizations about the election (6%).
Catholic and white evangelical Protestant voters are somewhat more likely than white mainline Protestant voters to say information related to the election was available in their places of worship. Roughly one-in-five Catholics who attend Mass at least monthly (22%) say information on political parties or candidates was made available in their parishes this year, while 16% of white evangelical Protestants who attend church monthly say this. By comparison, only 5% of white mainline Protestants who attend church monthly received election-related information through their places of worship. (Other religions are not included in this analysis because of insufficient sample sizes.)
