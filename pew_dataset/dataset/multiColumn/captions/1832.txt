In practical terms, this type of hyperinflation means that the price of goods can shoot up precipitously over the course of only a week. The turbulent economy has left many Venezuelans saying they cannot afford key necessities. In the new Center survey, about three-quarters say there were times over the past year when they did not have enough money to buy food their family needed, 80% said they sometimes could not pay for their family’s medical or health care, and 87% said they could not always afford to buy clothing for their family. These differences cut across cleavages in society: Men and women, older and younger Venezuelans, and those with higher and lower levels of education are similarly likely to say they can’t afford these basics.
