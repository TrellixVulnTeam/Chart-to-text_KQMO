About three-quarters (74%) of Republicans who agree with the Tea Party movement say there is a great deal of bias â€“ at least twice the percentage as in any other political group, including non-Tea Party Republicans (33%) and liberal Democrats (36%). Among news audiences, those who cite the Fox News Channel or the radio as their main source of campaign news are the most likely to say there is a great deal of bias in news coverage.
