The public has some degree of trust in information they are getting about the Ebola outbreak from a variety of sources. A separate survey, conducted Oct. 16-19 among 1,000 adults, finds that majorities have at least some trust in the information they are hearing from local hospitals and health authorities (22% a lot, 40% some) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (22% a lot, 36% some). Most also trust the news organizations covering Ebola at least somewhat (19% have a lot of trust, 38% have some).
Democrats are more likely than Republicans to trust the CDC’s information about Ebola While about two-thirds of Democrats have some trust in Ebola information from the CDC (68% vs. 30% with less trust), Republicans are divided (50% at least some trust, 49% not much or at all). And one-in-three Democrats (33%) have “a lot” of trust, compared with 15% of Republicans. Democrats also place more trust in news organizations covering the outbreak (72%-26%); among Republicans, 54% have some trust and 45% do not.
