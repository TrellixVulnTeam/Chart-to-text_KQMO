This chart shows average family income, average family size, and average income per person for natives, legal immigrants, and unauthorized migrants based on the March 2004 CPS.
The incomes of unauthorized migrants and their families shown here reflect the comparative levels of education shown earlier and the occupations/industries where they work. Specifically, average family income of unauthorized migrant families is more than 40% below the average income of either legal immigrant or native families. In addition to education and occupation differences, another factor contributing to this difference is the lower labor force participation of unauthorized females that results in fewer workers per family than in the other groups.
A key element of income is the amount available per person in the family. Because unauthorized families tend to be larger with lower incomes than natives, the difference in average income per person5 is even larger than the difference in income. Thus, the average income per person in unauthorized families ($12,000) is about 40% less than legal immigrant families and more than 50% below the per capita income in native families.
