Americans are more wary of economic globalization. About half of Americans (49%) say U.S. involvement in the global economy is a bad thing because it lowers wages and costs jobs; only 44% think it is a good thing because it creates new markets and opportunities for growth. Europeans tend to embrace economic globalization, although Greece is a clear exception.
