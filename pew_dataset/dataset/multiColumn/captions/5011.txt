For example, among those who have heard of CNN but did not get news there, expressions of trust and distrust are roughly equal – 37% trust and 33% distrust. (Fully 80% of those who heard of it and consumed it say they trust it.) PBS, however (trusted by 84% of those who got news there in the past week), was roughly twice as trusted as distrusted outside its core audience (34% v. 16%).
Higher levels of distrust were common among non-consumers of news sources that attract more ideologically aligned audiences. Al Jazeera America, with its 71% left-leaning audience, has considerably more distrust than trust among those who have heard of it but did not get political news there in the past week: 40% to 14%. For The Glenn Beck Program (87% of its audience is right-leaning), the gap is even greater: 55% of those who know it but don’t get news there distrust it, while just 12% trust it.
