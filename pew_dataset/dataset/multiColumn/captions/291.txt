As they prepare to meet in a vice-presidential debate on Oct. 7, both Republican Mike Pence and Democrat Kamala Harris elicit more negative than positive feelings from registered voters, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.
Around half of registered voters (51%) give Pence “cold” ratings, while slightly more than a third (36%) give him “warm” ratings and 12% have neutral feelings.
For Harris, 48% express cold feelings, 39% have warm feelings and 13% give her neutral ratings, according to the Sept. 30-Oct. 5 survey of 11,929 adults, including 10,543 registered voters.
The results are based on a “feeling thermometer” in which 100 represents the warmest, most positive score and 0 represents the coldest, most negative rating. Ratings above 50 are considered warm, ratings below 50 are considered cold and ratings of 50 are neutral.
