Nearly half of the public says they heard nothing at all last week about the Food and Drug Administration looking into whether artificial food dyes can cause hyperactivity in children or the publication of grisly photos tied to allegations that U.S. soldiers murdered civilians in Afghanistan.
Fully 48% say they heard nothing at all about the FDA action; 12% say they heard a lot about this story and 40% say they heard a little. Women are almost twice as likely to say they heard a lot about this topic than are men (15% versus 8%).
Fully 47% say they heard nothing at all about the publication of photos and videos allegedly taken by U.S. soldiers accused of killing Afghans; 11% say they heard a lot about the photos and videos, while 41% say they heard a little. Last fall, when five soldiers tied to these incidents were charged with premeditated murder, 15% had heard a lot about the story and 45% had heard a little.
More had heard about a Supreme Court hearing last week about a major gender discrimination case involving Wal-Mart. Two-in-ten (20%) say they heard a lot about this story, while 44% say they heard a little. About a third (35%) say they heard nothing at all about this. The hearing dealt with whether women who have worked at Wal-Mart may sue the retailer in a class action law suit.
