Two years ago, Pew Research Center also found an increase in the proportion of Americans who agreed that “since the U.S. is the most powerful nation in the world, we should go our own way in international matters, not worrying too much about whether other countries agree with us or not.” The percentage agreeing jumped to 44%, from just 28% in 2006.
But in the new survey, the number saying the U.S. should go its own way in the world has fallen back to 35%, which is more in line with measures over the past few decades; 62% disagree with this statement , up from 51% in 2009.
