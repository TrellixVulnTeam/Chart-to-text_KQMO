Americans continue to say they are tracking news about the environmental disaster unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico more closely than any other story. More than half (52%) say this is the news they are following most closely. Looking at a separate measure, 57% say they are following the oil leak very closely, about the same level of interest as the past five weeks.
According to PEJ, media coverage last week was divided among several major stories. The oil leak accounted for 15% of the newshole, not much more than the 13% of coverage devoted to the economic developments.
The Senate Judiciary Committee’s confirmation hearings on Kagan’s Supreme Court nomination accounted for 11% of coverage, though the public showed relatively little interest. Just 16% say they followed this news very closely. That’s not much different from the 20% in July 2009 who said they were very closely following the hearings for President Obama’s first Supreme Court nominee, Sonia Sotomayor. Kagan’s hearings produced no surprises and little drama; 3% say this was the news they followed most closely.
Interest in the arrest by American law enforcement of 11 people suspected of being spies for Russia was similar to interest in Kagan’s confirmation hearings; 15% say they followed this story very closely. It was the story followed most closely by 2%. Coverage of the alleged spy ring accounted for 8% of the newshole.
