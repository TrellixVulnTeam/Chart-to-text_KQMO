Majorities of Democrats say the gender, race or sexuality of the Democratic nominee in 2020 wouldn’t make a difference in their enthusiasm. Nearly two-thirds of Democrats (64%) say it would not make a difference in their enthusiasm if the party’s nominee is a woman, while nearly a third (31%) say they would feel more enthusiastic. Among Democratic women younger than 50, 45% say they would be more enthused over a woman nominee, compared with 28% of Democratic men under 50.
Relatively small shares of Democrats overall say their enthusiasm would be affected if the party’s nominee is black or Hispanic. However, about a third of black Democrats (35%) say they would be more enthusiastic if the nominee is black and 44% of Hispanic Democrats say the same about a Hispanic nominee.
