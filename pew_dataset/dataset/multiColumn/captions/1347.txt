Another way of looking at youth employment, or the lack thereof, is by focusing on “NEETs” – that is, young people who are neither employed nor in education or training. In 2018, 14.8% of all Americans ages 16 to 29 – or about 9 million young people – were NEETs. In 2013, the first year for which comparable data is available, there were about 11 million NEETs in the U.S., or 18.5% of the 16-to-29 population. The Center’s 2016 analysis found that in the U.S., the NEET youth population is more female than male (57% to 43%). Two-thirds of U.S. NEETs have a high-school education or less, and black and Hispanic 16- to 29-year-olds were more likely than whites and Asians to be NEETs.
