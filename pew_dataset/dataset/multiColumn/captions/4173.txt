Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people generally see less social acceptance of transgender Americans than for lesbians, gay men and bisexuals in the country, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2013. Among all LGBT respondents, eight-in-ten say there is only a little (59%) or no (21%) social acceptance for transgender people in society, while far fewer say there is little to no acceptance for gay men (27%), lesbians (14%) or bisexual women (21%) or men (46%).
The 2013 Pew Research Center survey also found that LGBT adults are less religious than the general public in the U.S. And large majorities of LGBT Americans say that certain religious institutions – particularly Islam (84%), the Mormon church (83%), the Catholic Church (79%) and evangelical churches (73%) – are unfriendly toward people like them. LGBT adults have more mixed views of the Jewish religion and mainline Protestant churches, with 47% and 44% of LGBT adults, respectively, describing those religions as unfriendly, one-in-ten describing each of them as friendly and the rest saying they are neutral.
