In May 1999, shortly after the shootings at Columbine High School, more than twice as many Americans said it was more important to control gun ownership (65%) than to protect the rights of Americans to own guns (30%). Support for gun control slipped to the mid-50% range in 2000 and remained at about that level through 2008.
Since April 2008, the number saying it is more important to control gun ownership has fallen by 12 points â€“ from 58% to 46%. Over this period, there has been a nine-point increase (from 37% to 46%) in the proportion saying it is more important to protect gun rights.
