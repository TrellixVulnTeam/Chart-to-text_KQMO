China’s reputation among Americans had already fallen to an all-time low in Pew Research Center polling as of March, with roughly two-thirds viewing the country unfavorably. Now, a survey conducted April 29 to May 5 finds that Americans expect China’s international reputation will suffer because of how the country has handled the coronavirus outbreak, which originated within its borders. Americans are also critical of how China has handled the global pandemic and are skeptical of information from the Chinese government.
Nearly all Americans are skeptical of information from the Chinese government about the coronavirus outbreak. More than eight-in-ten Americans (84%) distrust information from the Chinese government about the coronavirus outbreak, including nearly half (49%) who have no trust in it at all. This is more than twice as many as say they have no trust at all in the information coming from the World Health Organization (18%), an organization whose handling of the virus is given mixed – and partisan – evaluations.
