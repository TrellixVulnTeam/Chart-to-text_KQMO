The economy was the public’s top story last week, according to the latest News Interest Index survey, conducted Dec. 1-4 among 1,008 adults by Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. Three-in-ten (30%) say they followed news about the economy more closely than any other story. Somewhat fewer (23%) cited the presidential campaign as their top story.
News about the presidential election – much of it focused on the final days of Herman Cain’s bid for the Republican nomination – topped news coverage, accounting for 23% of the newshole. News about the economy made up 17%, according to the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ).
