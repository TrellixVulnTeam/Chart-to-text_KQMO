Over the course of George W. Bush’s two terms in office, Democratic ratings of the court remained lower than Republican ratings, and lower than they had been following Bill Clinton’s nominations of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the court (in December of 1997, 81% of Democrats had a favorable impression of the Supreme Court).
Republican favorability is down from 70% in April 2009 — a month prior to Sotomayor’s nomination — and 80% in April 2008 in the last year of Bush’s presidency. As a result, for the first time since the Clinton administration, more Democrats (65%) than Republicans (52%) have a favorable impression of the court.
