The public showed only modest interest in the week’s other top stories, continuing a trend seen throughout much of 2011. A series of major breaking news stories – including the shootings in Tucson, the upheaval in the Middle East, the disasters in Japan and the killing of Osama bin Laden – has dominated the news agenda for both the media and the public this year. And that has routinely resulted in less public attention to other news, such as the debate in Washington over how to address the federal deficit and long-term debt and the early stages of the 2012 presidential campaign.
