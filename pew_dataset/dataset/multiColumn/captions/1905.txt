The analysis also examined the kinds of hospitals Americans live closest to. Nationally, two-thirds of Americans (65%) live closest to a nonprofit hospital, but people in rural areas are more likely than those in suburban and urban areas to live closest to a government-run hospital. Around one-in-six rural Americans (17%) live closest to a hospital run by the government. While this is about the same as the share in urban areas (14%), itâ€™s larger than the share in suburban areas (10%) Whether a hospital is nonprofit, for-profit or owned by the government can have implications for the types of services it provides, previous research has found.
