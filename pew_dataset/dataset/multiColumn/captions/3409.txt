While Obama’s personal favorability ratings are even higher than his job approval – 64% have a favorable impression of the president – the public has an even more positive opinion of Michelle Obama: 72% view the first lady favorably, while just 22% view her unfavorably.
Still, she remains far less positively viewed among Republicans and Republican leaners (44% favorable) than Democrats and Democratic leaners (93% favorable). In particular, conservative Republicans are more likely to have an unfavorable view of the first lady than a favorable one (52% vs. 33%).
