The types of summer jobs that teenagers are holding has changed over time, too. More than 2.1 million of the estimated 6.2 million teens who were employed last July (34.2%) worked in the “accommodation and food services” industry – restaurants, hotels and the like – compared with 1.9 million (22.6%) in July 2000, according to BLS data. In fact, this industry was the only major employer of teens that had more teen workers last July than in July 2000 – a span in which the number of all employed 16- to 19-year-olds fell by more than 2.2 million, or 26.5%. (That partly reflects overall employment in the accommodation and food services industry, which rose 38% between July 2000 and July 2018.)
But retail, once the leading summer employer of teens, has seen a steep falloff. Last July, 1.2 million teens worked in the retail sector, compared with more than 2 million in July 2000 – a 41% drop. (Among all workers, by comparison, non-seasonally adjusted retail employment was about 4% higher last July than it was in July 2000.) Retail accounted for 19.3% of teen summer jobs in July 2018, down from 24% in July 2000.
