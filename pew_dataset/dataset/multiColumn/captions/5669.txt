Media companiesâ€™ rush to acquire local television stations produced largely positive results in the third quarter, but some companies suffered losses tied to a plunge in advertising dollars.
The leaders were Nexstar, at 40% growth, and Sinclair, at 35%. Nexstar owns 75 television stations, which reach 44 markets across the country, and Sinclair operates 163 television stations in 77 markets.
Seven companies showed revenue declines year-to-year, with Scripps (-21%) and Washington Post Co. (-18%) suffering the biggest losses. (Following the sale of the flagship paper, The Washington Post Co. is being renamed the Graham Holdings Co.) Scripps owns 19 local TV stations in 13 markets and The Washington Post Co. owns six stations in major cities in Florida, Texas and Michigan.
