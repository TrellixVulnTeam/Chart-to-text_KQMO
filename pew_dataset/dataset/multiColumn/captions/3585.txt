But more generally, Americans are somewhat skeptical about the value of a college degree in the job market: Only 16% of all U.S. adults – including 13% of those with at least a four-year college degree – say that a bachelor’s degree prepares students “very well” for a well-paying job in today’s economy, while an additional 51% say it prepares students somewhat well. And 12% say a two-year associate degree prepares students very well (with 46% saying it prepares them somewhat well). About a quarter of Americans (26%) say that certification programs in a professional, technical or vocational field prepares students very well (52% say somewhat well).
