In much of Eastern Europe, there is now greater acceptance of post-communist political changes compared with Pulse of Europe surveys conducted by the then-Times Mirror Center for the People & the Press in 1991, as the Soviet Union was collapsing.

Only about half of those in Ukraine and Russia approve of the political changes that have occurred since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
