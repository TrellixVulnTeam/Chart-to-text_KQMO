When it comes to parenting, dads are harder on themselves than moms are, especially dads who say they donâ€™t spend enough time with their children. Among working dads who say they spend too little time with their kids, only 49% say they are doing an excellent or good job as a parent. In contrast, among dads who say they spend the right amount of time with their kids, 81% give themselves high marks for their parenting.
