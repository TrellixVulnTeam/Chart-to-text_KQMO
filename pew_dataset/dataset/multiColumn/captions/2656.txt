As Mexico prepares to host the fifth round of negotiations over the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), most Americans (56%) say that the pact is good for the United States, while just a third (33%) say it is bad.
More than half of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents have a negative view of NAFTA: 54% say the agreement is bad for the U.S., compared with 35% who say it is good. Democratic views are highly positive: 72% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say NAFTA is good for the U.S., while just 18% think it is bad for the country.
Views of NAFTA are more positive than negative across most demographic groups. Assessments are especially positive among those with a postgraduate degree (70% good for U.S.) and adults ages 18 to 29 (69%).
