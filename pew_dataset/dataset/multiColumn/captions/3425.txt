Republicans remain more skeptical than Democrats that Cuba will become more democratic in the next few years.
Only about a third of Republicans and Republican leaners (34%) say Cuba will become more democratic; 53% say it will remain about the same as it is today, while 4% say Cuba will become less democratic. By contrast, half of Democrats and Democratic leaners – including 56% of liberal Democrats – say Cuba will become more democratic in the years ahead.
