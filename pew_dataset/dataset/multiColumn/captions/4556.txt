Those who say global warming is happening as a result of human activity increasingly believe that it is a very serious problem: Today, fully three-quarters (75%) say this, up 17 points from 2013. And although just 33% of those who attribute warming to natural patterns in the earthâ€™s environment say it is a very serious problem, that reflects a 10-point increase since 2013. Among those who say there is no solid evidence of global warming, just 8% say global warming is a very serious problem, unchanged since 2013.
