There are some modest demographic differences in how often Americans talk about the outbreak. Women are more likely than men (47% vs. 41%) to say they talk about it most or almost all of the time, as are black adults (52%) when compared with Hispanic (46%) and white adults (42%). Older people appear to be at higher risk from the virus, but they are less likely than younger Americans to talk about it frequently: Among those ages 65 and older, 38% say they talk about it most or almost all of the time, lower than the shares in all other age groups.
Education and partisan identification are also linked to how often Americans talk about the virus. Half of college graduates say they talk about it with others most or all of the time, but the share falls to 43% among those with some college education and 39% among those with a high school diploma or less.
