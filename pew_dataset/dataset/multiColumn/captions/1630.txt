Support for increased spending on health care is much higher than it was in 2013, but not as high as it was in the early 2000s. Today, about half (53%) say they would increase spending on healthcare. In 2013, about four-in-ten (38%) said this. But in 2001, fully seven-in-ten Americans (71%) said spending for health care should be increased.
Democrats continue to be much more likely to say spending should be increased than Republicans â€“ about seven-in-ten Democrats (73%) say this, compared with just 27% of Republicans. The numbers saying this in both parties are largely unchanged since 2017, though both parties are more likely to say this than they were six years ago.
