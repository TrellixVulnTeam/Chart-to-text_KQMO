As has been the case throughout the 2008 presidential campaign, Democrats Clinton and Obama remain by far the most visible presidential candidates. Currently, 38% of Americans say that Obama is the candidate they have been hearing the most about in the news lately, while 31% name Clinton. By comparison, just 13% say that they have been hearing the most about Republican John McCain (up from 5%, Jan 18-21). Far fewer people named Republican presidential hopefuls Mike Huckabee (2%) and Ron Paul (1%) or Mitt Romney (2%) who suspended his campaign last week.
