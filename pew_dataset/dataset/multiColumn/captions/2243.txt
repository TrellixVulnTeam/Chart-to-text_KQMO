The new survey also asked Americans to weigh the importance of government versus private investment in research funding. A majority of Americans (57%) say government funding is essential for scientific progress, while 42% say private funding will ensure enough progress even without government funding. The share saying government investment is essential is broadly consistent with previous Pew Research Center surveys that again used different survey methods and somewhat different question wording.
Liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans have different views on this question. About eight-in-ten liberal Democrats (78%) say government funding of research is essential for scientific progress. By contrast, 31% of conservative Republicans say government investment is essential, while two-thirds (67%) say private investment will ensure enough progress is made, even without government funding.
