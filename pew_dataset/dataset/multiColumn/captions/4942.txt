In addition to Egypt, political participation is also relatively high in several of the other Middle Eastern nations surveyed, including Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. Tunisia has the lowest levels in the region, with just 17% reporting high political engagement, despite the fact that its 2011 Jasmine Revolution was the first of the Arab Spring anti-government protests. Along with Middle Easterners, Africans also report high levels of political engagement. Six-in-ten Kenyans are in the high participation category, as are 52% of Senegalese. Ghanaians report the lowest participation in the region, with just 24% among the highly-engaged political participants.
