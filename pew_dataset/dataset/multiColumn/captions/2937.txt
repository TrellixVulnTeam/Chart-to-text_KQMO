In addition to the differences in their admission categories, green card holders who are new arrivals and those who adjust their status also differ in age and, to some degree, in where they come from, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the recently released Department of Homeland Security data.
The top birth countries for both groups included Mexico, China and India (these are also the top origin countries in the overall U.S. immigrant population). But beyond that, the country profiles of these two groups differ somewhat.
Among the birth countries with the most people who adjusted their status were Cuba and South Korea, whose majority of nationals have been admitted in the employment-related category. New arrivals were more likely to be from the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Vietnam (overwhelmingly with family sponsorship), and the Philippines (mainly with family sponsorship).
