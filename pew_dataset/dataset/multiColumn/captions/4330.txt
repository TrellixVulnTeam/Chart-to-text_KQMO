Candidate Donald Trump has drawn attention to the issue of illegal immigration with his proposals to force Mexico to build a wall along the southern border and force deportations of those living in the U.S. illegally. But even before he made immigration an issue, about six-in-ten (59%) Republicans said in May that their party was not doing a good job representing their views on illegal immigration. This includes about two-thirds (65%) of Republicans who opposed legal status for undocumented immigrants. More than half (55%) who did favor a path to legal status also were unhappy with the party.
