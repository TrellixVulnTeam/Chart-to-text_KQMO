Some 42% of conservative Republicans think of scientists as politically liberal, up 14 percentage points from 28% in 2009. At the other end of the spectrum, liberal Democrats are also more likely than in 2009 to perceive scientists as generally liberal â€“ 30% do so, up from 21%. The views among other party/ideology groups have stayed roughly the same over this time period, however.
