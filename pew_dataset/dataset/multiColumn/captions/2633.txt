The Colorado case has reached the high court amid a backdrop of rising societal acceptance of homosexuality and same-sex marriage. Seven-in-ten Americans now say homosexuality should be accepted by society, up from 51% who held this view in 2006. Even among Republicans and those who lean toward the GOP, a slim majority (54%) now say society should accept homosexuality.
