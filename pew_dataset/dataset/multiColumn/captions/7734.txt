Voter attention to the 2004 election continues to run high relative to other recent elections. Two-thirds of voters (67%) say they have given “quite a lot” of thought to the coming presidential election, up from 58% in June. There was a similar rise in public interest in the early summer of 1992, when fully 72% of voters have given a lot of thought to the race by August, up from 63% in June of that year. By comparison, in 1996 and 2000 voters had not given this much thought to the election until October, within weeks of election day.
