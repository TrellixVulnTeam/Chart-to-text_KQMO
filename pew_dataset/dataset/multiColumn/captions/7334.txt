Job concerns are closely related to a personâ€™s income and education levels. Nearly eight-in-ten (78%) Americans with household incomes under $30,000 annually say that jobs are difficult to find in their area, up 17 percentage points from the 61% recorded last November. By comparison, among Americans with incomes of $75,000 or more fewer than half (46%) say jobs are difficult to find, up only seven points since last November. Similarly, roughly seven-in-ten (71%) Americans with a high school degree or less see limited job opportunities in their area, compared with 51% of those with a college degree.
