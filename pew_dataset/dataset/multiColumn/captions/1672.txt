In contrast, just 13% of Democrats approve of the job Republican leaders are doing. These views have not changed significantly in recent years.
Democrats and Democratic leaners feel similarly about their party leaders as Republicans do about theirs. About half (54%) of Democrats say they approve of the job Democratic leaders in Congress are doing. This is a somewhat higher share than the 47% who approved in June 2018. Only about one-in-ten Republicans (11%) approve of the way Democratic leaders are handling their jobs.
