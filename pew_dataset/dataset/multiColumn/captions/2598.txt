As with many other attitudes, partisans’ trust in government tracks party control of the presidency. The share of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who say they trust the government at least most of the time is higher today (22%) than during the Obama administration.
Yet the current level of Republican trust in government is relatively low compared with past Republican administrations. The share of Republicans saying they trusted the government always or most of the time was much higher during most of George W. Bush’s presidency, and throughout the entire administrations of George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan.
Just 15% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say they trust the federal government always or most of the time, which is lower than during the Obama administration and among the lowest levels of Democratic trust in government in the past 60 years. Democrats’ trust in government was about this low toward the end of Bush’s presidency in 2008.
