There are demographic differences among Republicans on many of these issues – and in views of Trump. For instance, Republicans younger than 30 are much less likely to say that immigrants to the United States threaten our values than those 65 or over (57% vs. 83%). Younger Republicans are also less positive in their assessments of Trump (37% warm vs. 56% among those 65 and older).
In addition to age, both education and ideology are associated with views of Trump within the GOP. Republican voters with less than a college degree –particularly those with some college experience – feel more warmly toward Trump than those with more education. And conservative GOP voters rate Trump higher than moderate and liberal GOP voters.
