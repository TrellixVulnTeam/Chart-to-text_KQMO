The public’s take on the chances that health care legislation will be enacted this year shifted dramatically after Brown’s Jan. 19 victory, which will end the Democrats’ effective control of 60 Senate seats and their ability to stop Republican filibusters. About two-thirds (67%) now say they do not think a health care reform bill will be passed into law this year, while 27% say they think it will, according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey conducted Jan. 22-25 among 1,010 adults nationwide by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. This is a reversal from the previous week’s News Interest Index survey when 57% said they thought legislation would pass this year, while 33% said it would not.
