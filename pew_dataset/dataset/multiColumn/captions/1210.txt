A majority of Americans and veterans associate discipline and patriotism with veterans. Majorities among veterans (61%) and the general public (64%) say most Americans look up to people who have served in the military. And veterans see themselves as more disciplined (84%) and patriotic (71%) than those who have not served in the military. Most Americans agree with this: 67% of all adults say being disciplined better describes veterans than non-veterans, and 59% say the same about being patriotic.
