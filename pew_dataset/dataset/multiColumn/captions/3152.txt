Americans have uniformly negative views of North Korea and its nuclear ambitions â€“ a subject likely to be high on the agenda when President Donald Trump meets in Florida this week with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Overall, 78% of Americans have an unfavorable view of the communist nation ruled by Kim Jong Un, with 61% holding a very unfavorable opinion. Negative attitudes toward North Korea are shared across demographic groups, though more college-educated Americans hold negative views (91%) than do Americans with a high school education or less (69%). Unlike public opinion on other aspects of U.S. foreign policy, there are no significant partisan divides on attitudes toward North Korea.
