Dramatic events in London and Scotland last week attracted a large news audience. Roughly a third of the public paid very close attention to news that British police had found and defused two car bombs in London, and another 31% followed the story fairly closely. Fully 21% said this was the single news story they followed more closely than any other — making it the most closely followed news story of the week.1 Interest in the attempted bombings did not reach the level of last summer’s major terrorism scare. In August 2006, 54% of the public paid very close attention to news about a foiled plot to blow up planes flying from England to the U.S. using liquid explosives.
Last week’s events in the United Kingdom received a substantial amount of news coverage in the U.S. Although the story did not break until Friday morning, it was the fourth most heavily covered news story of the week, accounting for 5% of the overall coverage. For Friday alone, the London story represented 27% of the news coverage for all sectors and 63% of cable news.
