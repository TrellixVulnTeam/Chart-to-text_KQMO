More than half in every country surveyed have little or no confidence in Cuban President Raul Castroâ€™s ability to handle international affairs. Overall, a median of 62% across the six countries say this, while only 21% have confidence in the Cuban leader.
Lack of confidence is most pronounced in Venezuela (73% no confidence) and Brazil (70%). In Venezuela, those on the ideological right are far more likely to have no confidence in Castro (89%) compared with those on the left (40% no confidence vs. 57% confidence). But in no country surveyed do more than a third of the public have confidence in the younger Castro brother.
