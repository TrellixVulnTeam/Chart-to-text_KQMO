Two-thirds of the public (66%) heard at least a little about Rick Perry’s memory lapse at a Republican presidential candidate debate last week; 36% say they heard a lot and 30% say they heard a little about this. Another third (33%) say they heard nothing at all.
The public heard less about last week’s off-year elections and ballot initiatives, some of which were seen as indicators of voter sentiment heading into 2012. Just 14% say they heard a lot about the elections, while 39% say they heard a little. Nearly half (46%) say they heard nothing at all about this news. Partisans are about equally likely to have heard at least a little about last week’s elections.
