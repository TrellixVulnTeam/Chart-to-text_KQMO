Reflecting Republicansâ€™ overwhelming opposition to the Iran nuclear agreement, 69% of possible GOP primary voters say they would be more likely to support a candidate who wants to end the nuclear agreement. Just 14% say they would be less likely to support a candidate who takes this position.
Most possible GOP primary voters also say they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who wants to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood (56%) and to use U.S. ground forces to fight ISIS (53%). Other candidate positions, including deporting all immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally and compromising with Democrats, have less appeal. And as many possible Republican primary voters say they would less likely (34%), as more likely (31%), to vote for a candidate who wants to raise taxes on wealthy Americans.
