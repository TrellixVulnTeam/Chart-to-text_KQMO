Public interest in news about economic conditions remained high last week amid reports about federal legislation to uplift the housing market and official projections of a half-trillion-dollar national budget deficit. About half of all Americans (47%) paid very close attention to news about the state of the U.S. economy and another 34% were following this news fairly closely. Three-in-ten (30%) said it was the news they followed most closely for the week, making the economy the public’s top story. Actual news coverage of the economy was the second most heavily covered story last week. The national news media devoted 5% of all coverage to the topic.
For the third straight week, the audience for campaign news totaled three-in-ten Americans who were following the presidential race very closely. While not the most closely followed news item of the week, the campaign was the public’s number two story, with 27% of Americans citing the campaign as the story they were following more closely than any other. A far greater share of the national newshole was devoted to the presidential campaign last week than to any other major news story. More than one-quarter of all news (26%) focused on the campaign.
Roughly one-in-four Americans (27%) followed news about the Iraq war very closely and 11% listed this as their most closely followed story for the week. News about an earthquake that struck the Los Angeles area attracted the very close attention of 17% of the public. Predictably, residents of the West Coast followed the story more closely than residents of other regions of the country. The earthquake, which caused little damage last week, received 2% of all news coverage.
