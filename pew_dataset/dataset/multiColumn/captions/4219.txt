While itâ€™s hard to say whose account is the most accurate when it comes to how parenting and household responsibilities are shared, an analysis of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data provides a glimpse into how full-time working moms and dads spend their time. This analysis shows that while full-time working moms spend more time than full-time working dads on parenting and household tasks, the difference is modest. For example, mothers who work full time spend an average of 11.9 hours per week, or 1.7 hours per day, on housework, compared with 1.2 hours per day among fathers who work full time.
