Currently about half of Republicans (49%) say they are satisfied with the state of the nation. Though this is unchanged since February, it is up from 24% in January and 11% in late October, a few weeks before the 2016 election. Throughout the course of Barack Obama’s presidency, no more than about two-in-ten Republicans expressed satisfaction with the way things were going in the country.
By contrast, Democrats’ satisfaction with the country has plummeted following the election: Just 16% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say they are satisfied with the way things are going today. This is down from 33% in January and 52% in October.
