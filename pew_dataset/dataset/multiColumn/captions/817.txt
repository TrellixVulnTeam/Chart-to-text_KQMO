Africa has the youngest population of any region, with a median age of 20 – roughly a decade less than the global figure. All but one of the 20 countries with the lowest median ages are in Africa. (The exception is Afghanistan.) Four-in-ten Africans are below the age of 15 and just 6% are 60 or older.
Niger, in Western Africa, has the world’s youngest population. Half of Niger’s population is 14 or younger, and the median age is 15. Niger is one of the world’s poorest countries and ranks last on the UN Human Development Index. The fertility rate in Niger is the world’s highest, and life expectancy is among the world’s lowest. Like its neighbors Mali and Burkina Faso, Niger is burdened by escalating military conflicts.
