Diminished interest in the presidential campaign reflects not only changing views about the tone and content of the campaign but also declining news coverage of the presidential race. While media coverage of the campaign has fluctuated from week to week based on events, the overall amount of coverage is considerably less now than in February and March. During the month of February, national news organizations devoted, on average, nearly half of their weekly coverage to the campaign, according to the Project for Excellence in Journalismâ€™s (PEJ) News Coverage Index. In March, that average fell to below 40%.
