Many Germans see the U.S. as a top foreign policy partner; fewer Americans feel the same way about Germany. When asked which countries are their most important partners in global affairs, Germans name France more than any other country, but the U.S. is in the second spot. More than four-in-ten Germans say the U.S. is either their country’s first or second most important partner. Americans are much less likely to see Germany this way: Only 12% name Germany as one of America’s top two partners. Still, Germany does make the top four, trailing Great Britain and China and tying with Israel.
Democrats are more likely than Republicans to see Germany as an important partner for foreign policy. While 21% of Democrats name Germany as one of America’s top two international partners, only 5% of Republicans feel this way. Democrats also take a more positive view of Germany’s role in world affairs – 52% of Democrats say Germany does the right amount to help solve global problems, compared with 31% of GOP supporters and 37% of independents.
