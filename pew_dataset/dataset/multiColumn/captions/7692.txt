That study also found that a plurality of Americans (41%) believe that President Bush should choose someone who will keep the court about the same as it is now, while roughly equal numbers support a more conservative nominee (28%), or a more liberal one (24%).
Only two groups, Enterprisers (64%) and Social Conservatives (50%), clearly favor a choice that would make the court more conservative. In five of the other groups, pluralities ­ or, in the case of Upbeats and Disaffecteds, majorities ­ feel that the president should choose someone who would keep the court’s ideological balance about the same as it is now. Most Liberals (52%) would prefer a nominee who will make the court more liberal.
