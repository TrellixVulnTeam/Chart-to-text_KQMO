The first wave of Republicans who set out to succeed Speaker John Boehner all had less experience serving in the House than any lawmaker who rose to speaker in modern times. But the candidates’ relatively short tenures put them in the company of many of their fellow House Republicans today, more than half of whom were elected in 2010 or later.
Long years of service have been the norm for past speakers, most of whom had accumulated twice as much time in the House as today’s candidates before wielding the gavel. Boehner was not elected speaker until his 11th term in the House, nor was his immediate predecessor, Democrat Nancy Pelosi.
Previous speakers with the most prior House experience include John McCormack (D-Mass.), who was the last speaker without a high school degree, with 18 terms; the recently deceased Jim Wright (D-Texas) with 17 terms; and Joe Cannon (R-Ill.), the powerful 19th-century statesman with the ubiquitous cigar, with 15 terms.
