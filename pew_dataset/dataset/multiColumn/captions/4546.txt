Adherents of folk religions are the largest religious group in just three countries (Macau, Taiwan and Vietnam), but they are the second-largest group in 23 nations, including China (where “nones” are the biggest group). Hindus, meanwhile, make up the second-largest group in 12 countries, perhaps most notably Pakistan. Buddhists are the second-largest group in seven countries (including Japan). Jews are not the second-largest religious group in any nation.
