Views of Congress have grown more positive among Democrats – and less positive among Republicans – since Democrats won control of the House of Representatives last November. Since March 2018, the share of Democrats and Democratic leaners with a favorable opinion of Congress has risen 19 percentage points from 24% to 43%. The share of Republicans with a favorable view of Congress has declined 10 points since then (37% to 27%).
