While support for same-sex marriage has risen sharply among all age groups compared to even a decade ago, so-called “Millennials” (people born after 1980) are by far the most likely to say gay men and lesbians should be able to marry legally. In a March survey by the Pew Research Center, fully 70% of Millennials said they supported same-sex marriage. The report attributed much of the overall opinion shift to the arrival of that generation on the scene.
