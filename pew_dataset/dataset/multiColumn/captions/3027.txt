When it comes to trusting the UK government, people in Britain are evenly divided. Roughly half say that they trust the national government a lot or somewhat, and virtually the same number say they trust the government not much or not at all. Only 14% of the British public trusts the government a lot, while two-in-ten say they do not trust the government at all.
