An increasing share of Indonesians describe the country’s current and future economic situation as good. Before Jokowi was elected, about six-in-ten (62%) said the economy was doing poorly, but by 2014, more people rated the economic situation positively than negatively. As of last summer, about two-thirds said Indonesia’s economy was doing well.
The share of Indonesians who say their current economic situation is good increased to almost two-thirds (65%) in 2018. This positive sentiment stands in contrast with the state of the country’s currency, the rupiah, in 2018 – whose value depreciated to near record-low levels, edging close to values seen during the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis.
