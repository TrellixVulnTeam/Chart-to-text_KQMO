The representation of countries of birth among immigrant eligible voters is different than that among U.S. immigrants overall. For example, immigrant eligible voters born in Mexico account for 16% of all foreign-born eligible voters, far below their 25% share among all immigrants living in the U.S. By contrast, immigrant Filipino eligible voters make up 6% of foreign-born eligible voters but make up 4% of all U.S. immigrants. These gaps in representation among these immigrant populations reflect differences in naturalization rates.
