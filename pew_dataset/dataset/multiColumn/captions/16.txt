An estimated 1.4 million Hispanics of Guatemalan origin lived in the United States in 2017, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Guatemalans in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Guatemalan origin; this includes immigrants from Guatemala and those who trace their family ancestry to Guatemala.
Guatemalans are the sixth-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States, accounting for 2% of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017. Since 2000, the Guatemalan-origin population has increased 255%, growing from 406,000 to 1.4 million over the period. At the same time, the Guatemalan foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew by 171%, from 319,000 in 2000 to 864,000 in 2017. By comparison, Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, constituted 36.6 million, or 62%, of the Hispanic population in 2017.
