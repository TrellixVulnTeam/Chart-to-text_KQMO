Americans and Europeans may agree ISIS is a top threat, but they differ in how they rank other concerns. For example, while climate change is the second biggest concern in Europe, it is lower on the list in the U.S. Instead, Americans name cyberattacks as the second greatest threat. China’s emergence as a world power rates relatively low in both the U.S. and Europe, although Americans are more concerned than Europeans about Beijing’s growing power.
Many Americans and Europeans believe their national influence is waning, although Germans believe their country’s influence is on the rise. A 46% plurality of Americans believe the U.S. is less important and powerful than it was 10 years ago – a share that has been at historic highs in recent years. Majorities or pluralities also say their country is less important in Greece, Italy, Spain and France. However, just 11% hold this view in Germany, which in many ways has taken a more prominent role in European political and economic affairs over the past decade. A 62% majority there says Germany is more important than a decade ago.
