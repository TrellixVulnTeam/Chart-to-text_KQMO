A nationwide Pew Research Center survey in August found that substantial percentages of blacks see unfair treatment in many aspects of life, especially by the criminal justice system. Fully 70% said that blacks in their community were treated less fairly than whites in dealing with the police and about as many (68%) said the same about the courts. By contrast, just 37% of whites said blacks were treated less fairly by the police and 27% said they received less fair treatment by the courts.
