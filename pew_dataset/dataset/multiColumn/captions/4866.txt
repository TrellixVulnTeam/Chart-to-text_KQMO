Amid accelerating economic growth and falling unemployment, 27% of Americans rated the economy as excellent or good earlier this month, while 48% said it was only fair and 24% called it poor. The percent rating economic conditions as poor has declined nine points since October (from 33%). This marks the first time in Obama’s presidency that about as many have described the economy as excellent or good (27%) as poor (24%). Democrats are almost three times as likely to rate the economy as excellent or good than Republicans. About two-thirds (66%) of Americans say the economy is recovering, but not strongly, compared with just 16% who regard the recovery as strong. Expectations for the economy have improved somewhat with 31% saying it will be better a year from now compared with 27% last October.
Nearly four-in-ten (38%) say Obama’s economic policies since taking office have made economic conditions better, while 28% say they have made the economy worse, according to our Jan. 7-11 survey. Three-in-ten (30%) think they have not had much of an effect. On balance, this is the most positive rating of Obama’s economic impact since December 2009. The survey also found that more Americans have more confidence in Obama than Republican leaders to do the right thing on the economy: 49% have a great deal or fair amount of confidence in Obama compared with 37% who say they have more confidence in GOP leaders.
