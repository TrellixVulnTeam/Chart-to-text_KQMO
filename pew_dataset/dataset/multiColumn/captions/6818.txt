Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle continue to receive negative assessments from the public. Today, just a third (33%) approves of the Republican congressional leadership; about the same number (35%) approves of the Democratic leadership. While these evaluations have changed little in recent months, approval ratings for Democratic leaders are now far lower than they were in early 2009. Ratings for Republican leaders have shown less change over this period.
