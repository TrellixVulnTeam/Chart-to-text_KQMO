Two-thirds (66%) of Americans say that European companies building factories in the United States will mostly help the U.S. economy. Men (71%) more than women (62%) support such greenfield investment. And, there is strong support for it among Americans with at least a college degree (84%). A smaller proportion of Germans, roughly half (49%), express the view that American firms building plants in Germany will benefit the local economy. Men (55%) are more supportive than women (43%), as are Germans age 18 to 29 (55%) compared with people 50 years of age and older (44%). German ambivalence about such new U.S. investment may stem from a distrust of American business practices. A 2012 Pew Research Center survey found that nearly two-thirds of Germans (65%) disliked American ways of doing business.
