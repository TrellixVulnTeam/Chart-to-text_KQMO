More broadly, a majority of Americans (58%) say there should be limits on the number of jobs that businesses can replace with machines, even if those machines are better and cheaper. Fewer respondents (41%) took the opposite view that businesses are justified in replacing human workers, even if machines can do the work better and at a lower cost.
The public is more divided on the question of who bears responsibility for taking care of displaced workers in the event of widespread automation. Half say it is the government’s obligation, even if it means raising taxes substantially. Nearly the same share (49%) says it’s the obligation of individuals, even if machines have already taken many human jobs.
