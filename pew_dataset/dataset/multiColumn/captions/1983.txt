As with presidential approval, there have long been wide partisan gaps in confidence in the U.S. president on the world stage. In fact, in 12 of 14 surveys conducted since 2005, no more than around a third of adults in the opposing party have expressed confidence in the president to do the right thing regarding world affairs (the exceptions are 2005 under George W. Bush and 2009 under Obama). Yet the partisan gap in views of Trump is wider than for either Bush or Obama over this timeframe: Currently, only 16% of Democrats have confidence in Trump in world affairs, compared with 88% of Republicans.
