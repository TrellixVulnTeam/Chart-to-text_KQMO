Although only a third of the public followed campaign news very closely last week, an overwhelming majority (79%) knew that Hillary Clinton had won the Pennsylvania Democratic primary. This is much higher than the percentage that knew Clinton had won most of the March 4th primaries, which included Ohio and Texas (55%). It also exceeds the percentage who knew about her widely publicized win in the New Hampshire primary (67%).
