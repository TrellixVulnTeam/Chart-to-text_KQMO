The Middle East stands out among the regions surveyed for its relatively high rates of participation. In the home of the Arab Spring and its aftermath, a median of 53% fall into the “high” category of our participation index. Egypt, in particular, stands out. Twice in recent years, Egyptians have poured into the streets to oust a president – Hosni Mubarak in 2011 and Mohamed Morsi in 2013 – and 47% of Egyptians say they have participated in a protest at some point, the highest percentage among the nations surveyed.
