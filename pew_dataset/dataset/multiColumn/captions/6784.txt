News about the economy topped the publicâ€™s news interest last week, but Americans also showed strong interest in Hurricane Earl and news about the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraq.
About two-in-ten (19%) say they followed news about Earl more closely than other top news as the hurricane threatened much of the east coast. Nearly three-in-ten (28%) say they followed news about Earl very closely. According to PEJ, the media devoted 13% of coverage to the hurricane, which ultimately weakened to a tropical storm.
Another 17% say they followed news about Iraq and the combat troop withdrawal most closely; 36% say they followed this news very closely. News about the official end of combat operations in Iraq accounted for 8% of coverage.
