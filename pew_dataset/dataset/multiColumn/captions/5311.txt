Consider the findings of the Facebook study in which they varied how many positive and negative posts from friends test subjects were allowed to see. Posts were determined to be positive or negative if they contained a single positive or negative word. Then, the test subjectâ€™s own use of positive and negative words in their status updates was monitored for a week. In all, test subjects posted a total 122 million words, four million of which were positive and 1.8 million negative.
