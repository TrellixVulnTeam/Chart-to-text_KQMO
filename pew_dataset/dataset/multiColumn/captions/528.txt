White adults (79%) are more likely to say they have responded to the 2020 census than adults who are Hispanic (74%) or Black (66%). In part, this reflects current response patterns: Based on local-level response rates published by the Census Bureau, heavily Black or Hispanic neighborhoods have lower participation rates so far than heavily white neighborhoods, according to the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York. U.S. Black and Hispanic populations have been undercounted in past censuses, according to the Census Bureauâ€™s own research, while the white population has been overcounted.
Adults ages 18 to 29 also are less likely to say they have participated than adults in each older age group. A little over half of young adults (56%) say they or someone else in their household returned the census form, compared with 76% of adults ages 30 to 49 and even higher shares in age groups older than that.
