Nearly a third of the public followed news about the campaign very closely and four-in-ten listed the election as the story they were following more closely than any other. On Tuesday night, 38% of Americans tracked results of the New Hampshire primary as they were being reported. This is somewhat higher than the percentage that followed the results of the Iowa caucuses the previous week (30%). As was the case with Iowa, the vast majority of those who followed the New Hampshire primary results as they were coming in tracked them on television. Republicans, Democrats and Independents followed the New Hampshire results in roughly equal proportions.
Interest in news about the condition of the U.S. economy spiked amid widespread speculation about a possible recession. Fully 36% of the public followed news about the economy very closely, up from 27% in November. Interest in news about the economy hasn’t reached this level in over two years. Equal proportions of Republicans and Democrats (35%) followed economic news very closely last week. Next to the presidential campaign, the economy was cited most often as the news story Americans were following more closely than any other (14%). The national news media devoted 3% of its overall coverage to economic stories.
Several international stories were among last week’s top news interest stories. A quarter of the public paid very close attention to the current situation in Iraq, 11% listed this as their most closely followed story. Interest in the Iraq war has remained relatively stable over the past two months. News about an encounter between U.S. naval ships and several Iranian patrol boats in the Persian Gulf drew the very close attention of 25% of the public (6% listed this as their most closely followed story). Republicans were particularly interested in this story with 29% following very closely vs. 20% of Democrats.
