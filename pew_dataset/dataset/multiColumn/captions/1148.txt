Not only do veteran households fare better overall economically, households headed by racial or ethnic minority veterans and those with lower levels of education have significantly higher standards of living than their non-veteran counterparts. In 2017, the median incomes of non-Hispanic black and Hispanic veteran households were more than $20,000 greater than those of black and Hispanic non-veteran households. Among non-Hispanic whites, by comparison, the gap in median income between households headed by veterans and non-veterans was only about $5,100.
Income differences between veteran and non-veteran households are also large when examined by education level. The median income is roughly $20,000 higher for households headed by a veteran with a high school diploma, compared with non-veteran households with the same level of education. As education increases, the income gap between the two groups decreases to only about $2,500.
