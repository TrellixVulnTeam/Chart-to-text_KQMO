The public continued to focus most closely last week on the economy as new jobless numbers and other data reaffirmed the slow pace of the recovery. About a quarter (26%) say this was the story they followed most closely; 36% say they followed news about the economy very closely.
About two-in-ten (19%) say they very closely followed news about problems with how banks and other financial institutions have been handling foreclosures; 6% say this was the news they followed most closely. In terms of coverage, the nation’s economic troubles accounted for 11% of the newshole last week. That included 9% for economic news in general and 2% for news focused on the foreclosure problems, according to the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism.
Nearly a quarter (23%) say they followed news about the upcoming midterm congressional elections very closely; 15% say this was the news they followed most closely. The media devoted 25% of coverage to the campaigns. That made the elections the most covered story of the week as has been the case for the past four weeks.
