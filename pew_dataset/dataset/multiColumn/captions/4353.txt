An estimated 1.3 million Hispanics of Guatemalan origin resided in the United States in 2013, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey.
Guatemalans are the sixth-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States, accounting for 2.4% of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2013. Since 1990, the Guatemalan-origin population has increased almost fivefold, growing from 267,000 to 1.3 million over the period. At the same time, the foreign-born population of Guatemalan origin living in the U.S. grew almost 300%, up from 213,000 in 1990 to 834,000 in 2013. In comparison, Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, constituted 34.6 million, or 64.1%, of the Hispanic population in 2013.
