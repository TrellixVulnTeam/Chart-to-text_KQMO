Amid debate over which policies would do the most to improve the lives of the middle class, large percentages of Americans identify with the term â€“ either completely or with some qualification.
When asked to choose from five names for the social classes, 47% say they are middle class, 29% say they are lower-middle class, while 11% say they are upper-middle class.
Just 1% say they belong in the upper class. Somewhat more (10%) place themselves at the bottom of the scale and say they are lower class.
