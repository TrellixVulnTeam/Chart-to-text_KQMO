Who are the Millennials? One of our best-known studies was our 2010 report on the Millennials that described a generation of young adults who were confident, digitally connected and open to social change. We revisited Millennials this year, and found they are relatively unattached to organized politics and some core social institutions, like marriage and religion. Despite low levels of social trust and heavy debt burdens, they are optimistic about the future.
