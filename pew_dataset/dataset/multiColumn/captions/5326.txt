Less than half (47%) of Cuban registered voters nationwide now say they identify with or lean toward the Republican Partyâ€”down from the 64% who said the same about the GOP a decade ago, according to 2013 survey data. Meanwhile, the share of Cubans who identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party has doubled from 22% to 44% over the same time period, according to the survey of Hispanics.
