In Pew Research Center’s most recent knowledge quiz, just 33% knew that there are three women on the Supreme Court – Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. A higher percentage (39%) said that there are two women on the high court, while 14% said there is one and 4% said four.
An August 2013 survey included the names and photos of four justices – Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas – and asked which one had most often been the court’s “swing vote.” Despite the fact that there had been several closely divided Supreme Court cases during the 2012-2013 term in which Kennedy’s votes were often decisive, just 28% correctly identified him as the swing vote.
Chief Justice John Roberts is also not well-known. In July 2012, shortly after Roberts cast the deciding vote upholding most of the Affordable Care Act, just 34% identified Roberts as chief justice from a list that included Stephen Breyer, Harry Reid and William Rehnquist. That was not much better than the 28% who identified Roberts from a similar list in 2010.
