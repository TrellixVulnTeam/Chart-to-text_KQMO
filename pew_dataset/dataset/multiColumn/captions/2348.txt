While there is widespread public approval of U.S. negotiations with North Korea, nearly half of Americans (49%) say North Korea’s leadership is not serious about addressing international concerns about their country’s nuclear enrichment program. Fewer (38%) say North Korea is serious about addressing these concerns.
Views of whether North Korea is serious about addressing concerns over its nuclear program are similar among Republicans and Democrats. About half in both parties (50% of Republicans and 49% of Democrats) say they are not serious, while 36% of Republicans and 40% of Democrats say North Korean leaders are serious.
