Looking ahead, most Republicans want to see their party move in a more conservative direction. Nearly six-in-ten Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters (58%) say they want the GOP to move in a more conservative direction, compared with 38% who want it to move in a more moderate direction. Republican views on their preferred ideological direction for the party are about the same as they have been following other recent midterm and presidential elections.
