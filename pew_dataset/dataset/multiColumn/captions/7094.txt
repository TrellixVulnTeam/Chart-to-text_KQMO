Public concern about the job situation, which surged earlier this year, has leveled off. Currently, 42% cite the job situation as the economic issue they worry about most, which is largely unchanged from March (42%) and February (45%). Last December, only 26% viewed jobs as their top economic concern.
Meanwhile, worries about rising prices – which dominated the public’s economic concerns last year during the rapid run-up in gas prices – are once again increasing. Currently, 29% say rising prices are the issue that most worries them, up from 22% in March. A year earlier, fully 49% named rising prices as their biggest economic worry.
As the stock market has become less volatile, concern over problems in financial markets has declined. Currently, 15% cite problems in the markets as their top economic worry, down from 21% in March and 31% last October. In March, comparable shares cited rising prices (22%) and problems in the financial markets (21%) as their biggest economic worry; now, nearly twice as many say they are most worried by rising prices (29% vs. 15%). Fewer than one-in-ten (8%) cite declining real estate values as the economic issue that they find most worrisome, a figure that has stayed fairly constant for more than a year.
