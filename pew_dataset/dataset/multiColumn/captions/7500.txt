The survey shows that Americans want more coverage of a number of aspects of the 2008 campaign, especially of the candidates’ positions on the issues. Roughly three- quarters of the public (76%) say they would like to see more coverage of candidates’ positions on the issues.
In addition to hearing more about policy issues, majorities want more coverage about the candidates’ debates (57%), and their personal backgrounds and experiences (54%).
The public shows less appetite for some other aspects of campaign coverage — notably, which candidate is ahead in the polls, and the candidates’ fundraising efforts. Slightly more say they want less coverage about who is leading in the polls than say they want more coverage of this (46% vs. 42%). Fully 57% say they want less coverage of candidate fundraising, compared with just 36% who want to hear more about fundraising efforts.
