A majority of GOP voters (56%) say they would be more likely to support a candidate who wants to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood; just 18% would be less likely to support such a candidate. About half (53%) say they would be more likely to back a candidate who wants to deploy U.S. ground forces to fight ISIS (22% less likely).
Opinion among possible GOP primary voters is more divided over a candidate who wants to deport all immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally (43% more likely, 29% less likely) or wants to compromise with members of the Democratic Party (41% more likely, 27% less likely). And nearly as many Republican voters say they would be less likely (34%) as more likely (31%) to support a candidate who wants to raise taxes on wealthy Americans; 34% say this would not be a major factor.
