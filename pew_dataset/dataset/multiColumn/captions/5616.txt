Drone Warfare: Washingtonâ€™s use of drones to target extremists in countries such as Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia is likely to continue to fuel anti-American sentiment because it is widely opposed around the world. Among the 39 nations surveyed by the Pew Research Center in 2013, half or more of the public in 31 countries disapproved of such military action. But U.S. drone strikes could well continue in 2014. Half of Americans say such actions have made the United States safer from terrorism.
