In early January, women were also less positive about prospects for the coming year than were men â€“ and less optimistic than they had been a year earlier. Just 43% of women said they expected 2017 to be a better year than 2016, compared with 56% of men. In January 2016, nearly identical shares of women (55%) and men (56%) said the coming year would be better for them.
