Overall, 15% of blacks and 18% of Latinos have used ride-hailing, similar to the 14% of whites who have done so, according to a Pew Research Center survey exploring the digital economy. And a new analysis of this survey data finds that Americans who live in majority-minority communities (census-block groups where more than 50% of residents are racial or ethnic minorities) are more likely than those who reside in predominately white neighborhoods to say that ride-hailing apps serve neighborhoods that taxis won’t visit. Just over half (53%) of ride-hailing users living in majority-minority communities feel that this statement describes ride-hailing well, compared with 46% of users living in majority-white neighborhoods. (Many ride-hailers – about four-in-ten overall – were unsure if this statement described ride-hailing well).
In sharp contrast to ride-hailing services, few blacks make use of home-sharing sites like Airbnb and VRBO: Just 5% of blacks have ever used these services, compared with 13% of whites. And although blacks are less likely than whites to say they travel overnight away from home for work or personal reasons, even among those who do travel on occasion, whites (16%) are still substantially more likely than blacks (5%) to use home-sharing services.
