Democratic voters are ideologically divided over going after big banks. For the most part, Democrats are less ideologically divided than Republicans in their views of possible candidate positions. But among possible Democratic primary voters who are liberal, 60% say they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who wants to reduce the size of large banks and financial institutions; just 38% of moderate and conservative Democratic voters say the same. Liberal Democratic voters also are far more likely than conservatives or moderates to express a positive view of a candidate who backs the Iran nuclear deal (53% vs. 31%).
But comparable percentages of liberals (44%) and conservatives and moderates (45%) say they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who wants to expand trade agreements. Hillary Clinton recently announced she does not support the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade pact negotiated by the Obama administration with a dozen Pacific nations. Clintonâ€™s main rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, also opposes the TPP.
