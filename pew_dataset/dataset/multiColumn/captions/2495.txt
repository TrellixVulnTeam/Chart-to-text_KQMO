The shares of Democrats saying that dealing with global climate change and protecting the environment have increased substantially in recent years. By contrast, attitudes among Republicans have largely held steady.
Today, 68% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say addressing climate change should be a top priority for Trump and Congress. Only 18% of Republicans and Republican leaners say it is a top priority, while 30% say it should be an “important but lower priority.”
More than twice as many Democrats (81%) than Republicans (37%) say protecting the environment should be a top priority for the president and Congress. The share of Democrats saying this is higher than at any point in the last decade and has increased nine points in the past year alone and 19 points since January 2016. Republicans’ views have shown less change over the last several years.
