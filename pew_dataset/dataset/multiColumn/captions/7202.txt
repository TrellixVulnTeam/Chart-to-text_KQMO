Many Americans continued to track the transition last week – 36% say they followed transition developments very closely – but with the debate in Congress over a multi-billion dollar plan to help the Detroit automakers stave off bankruptcy, official news that the nation was in recession, and reports that more than 500,000 jobs were lost in November, the public focused even more closely on economic news.
Four-in-ten (42%) followed economic news very closely; another 38% followed developments fairly closely. Reports about unemployment attracted the very close attention of 40%. In addition, 34% paid very close attention to the debate in Congress over government help for domestic automakers.
