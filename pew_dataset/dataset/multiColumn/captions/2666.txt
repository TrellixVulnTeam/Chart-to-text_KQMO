There is no consensus on whether society has been too accepting of transgender people or not accepting enough. About four-in-ten adults (39%) say society has not gone far enough in accepting people who are transgender, while 32% say society has gone too far and 27% say it has been about right.
Partisanship is at play here as well, as Republicans and Democrats express opposite views. While 60% of Democrats say society hasnâ€™t gone far enough, just 12% of Republicans say the same. Conversely, 57% of Republicans say society has gone too far, compared with 12% of Democrats.
