In our most recent survey in July, 48% of Americans expressed a favorable view of the court while 38% regarded it unfavorably, the first time the positive number had edged below the 50% mark. Prior to the decisions handed down in June, a March survey found 52% viewed the court favorably while 31 % had an unfavorable opinion. As recently as 2007, nearly three-quarters (72%) of Americans had viewed the court positively.
