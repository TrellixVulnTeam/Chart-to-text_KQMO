With most of the survey completed before airstrikes on Libya were launched by U.S. and allied forces, public interest in developments in Libya remained modest. About a quarter (26%) say they followed the conflict between rebels and government forces there very closely; 5% say this was the news they followed most closely. News about unrest in the Middle East accounted for 17% of coverage. Most of that (13%) focused on Libya.
The public continued to closely track economy news. Nearly half (46%) say they very closely followed news about the rising price of gas and oil. Nearly four-in-ten (38%) say they very closely followed news about the economy.
Few, though, say they followed either news about fuel prices or the economy in general more closely than any other news last week. About one-in-ten (11%) say they followed oil and gas price news most closely and 5% say they followed economic news most closely. News about gas prices and the economy more generally received little coverage.
