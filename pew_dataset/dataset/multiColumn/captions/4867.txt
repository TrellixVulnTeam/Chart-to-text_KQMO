Positive views of the job situation have edged up, but most Americans still say jobs are hard to find.
When it comes to job opportunities, 57% say that jobs are difficult to find in their community, while 36% say that there are plenty of jobs available, according to our recent survey. Views of job availability have edged higher over the past several years as the unemployment rate has declined. The percentage saying that there are plenty of jobs available in their community has not been higher since November 2007, before the start of the Great Recession. People under 50 are more likely than people over that age to say there are plenty of jobs available, as are people with higher education and income.
