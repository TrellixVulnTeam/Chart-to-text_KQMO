Here are some of the key takeaways from the survey conducted in seven European Union member countries – France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom:
Disillusion with the EU seems to be ending. Support for the European Union is rebounding just in time for the May 22-25 European Parliament elections. After a dramatic decline in the wake of the euro crisis, EU favorability is now on the rise in France, the United Kingdom and Germany. And faith in one of the EU’s founding principles – that European economic integration is good for their own country – is up in the UK, Poland and Germany. Median belief that European economic integration strengthens a person’s national economy is up as well, driven by a 15-point increase in the UK and a 12-point rise in Poland. However, EU support has yet to return to pre-crisis levels. Italians are increasingly critical of the institution.
