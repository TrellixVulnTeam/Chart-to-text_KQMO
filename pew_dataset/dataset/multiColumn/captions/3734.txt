Among Clinton and Trump supporters, only about a quarter (24%) who have at least some friends who back the other candidate are “pretty outspoken” about their voting preferences. That compares with 38% who say they have no close friends who support the other candidate.
Voters who have a lot of friends who back their preferred candidate are far more likely than others to be outspoken about who they are supporting: 45% say they are pretty outspoken, compared with just 24% of those with some friends who back their candidate and only 9% of those with few or no friends who back their candidate.
