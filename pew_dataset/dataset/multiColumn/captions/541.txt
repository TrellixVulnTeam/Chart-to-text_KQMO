A small group of lawmakers with extremely large followings dominate the congressional social media narrative. As is true of both ordinary Twitter users and legislators in other countries, the majority of audience engagement goes to a small group of lawmakers with extremely large followings. In the 116th Congress, the 10% of members with the most followers on Facebook and Twitter have received more than three-quarters of all favorites, reactions, shares and retweets on these platforms. For example, tweets from members of Congress received about 1.1 billion favorites since January 2019 â€“ and 907 million of those favorites went to just 10% of members.
Congress as a whole produces a vast amount of social media content each month. As a collective, the 116th Congress maintains over 2,000 active official, campaign and personal accounts on Facebook and Twitter (not counting institutional accounts that periodically change hands, such as committee chair or leadership accounts) with over a quarter-billion total followers between them.2 In an average month in 2020 so far, these accounts produce more than 100,000 tweets and Facebook posts, which receive tens of millions of audience favorites, reactions, shares and retweets.
