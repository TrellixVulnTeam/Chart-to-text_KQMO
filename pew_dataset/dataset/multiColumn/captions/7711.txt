This chart shows historical estimates of net migration from Mexico based on the author’s estimates and projected future levels according to the 3 different projection sources.
CONAPO has significantly higher migration than the UN, but does not show much of a decline from the initial values. CONAPO’s assumptions rely on a set of emigration rates but do not fully reflect the new information available from the U.S. Census 2000 on higher levels of migration to the United States during the late 1990s; if they did, the CONAPO projections might have higher current levels of migration to the U.S. as well as higher projected values.
