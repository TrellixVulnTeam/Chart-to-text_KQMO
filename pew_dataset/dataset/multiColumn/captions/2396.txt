On a per capita basis, for example, the U.S. deficit with Germany stands out. In 2017, Germany had a $777 per capita trade advantage with the U.S., a figure calculated by dividing the U.S. deficit with Germany by Germanyâ€™s population. Mexico had a $575 per capita advantage with its northern neighbor. But China, with its huge population, came in at only a $270 per capita advantage.
