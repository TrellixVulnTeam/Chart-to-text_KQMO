Paris Hilton’s legal problems became a national news story last week. Coverage of Hilton being released from and then returned to jail filled 4% of the newshole, making it the fifth most heavily covered story of the week. Roughly a third of Americans (34%) said they followed news about Hilton very or fairly closely, and 12% said it was the single news story they followed more closely than any other. In this regard, interest in Hilton surpassed interest in the 2008 presidential campaign, the G-8 summit, and talks between George Bush and Vladimir Putin. However, there was far more public interest in the situation in Iraq (25% most closely) than in Hilton’s out-again, in-again jail drama.
