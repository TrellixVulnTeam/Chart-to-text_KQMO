Urban and rural Americans have widely different views on some social and political issues, but differences can shrink when accounting for partisanship. People in urban areas are far more likely than those in rural communities to say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, that the government should do more to solve problems, that the economic system unfairly favors powerful interests and that whites benefit from advantages in society that black people do not have – but these differences shrink when accounting for partisanship. (A 62% majority of urban adults are Democrats or lean Democratic, while 54% in rural areas identify with or lean toward the Republican Party.)
Majorities in urban and rural areas feel misunderstood by those living in different types of communities. About two-thirds or more in rural and urban areas (70% and 65%, respectively) say people who don’t live in their same type of community don’t understand the types of problems faced by those who do. The share of suburbanites who say this is lower (52%).
