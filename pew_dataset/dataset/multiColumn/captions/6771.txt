While election news dominated media coverage last week, the public continued to show relatively modest interest. According to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Centerâ€™s Project for Excellence in Journalism, midterm news made up 30% of the newshole. Just more than one-in-ten (11%) say this was the news they followed most closely. Nearly a quarter (23%) say they followed election news very closely.
Three-in-ten Republicans say they followed election news very closely last week, not much different from the 24% of Democrats that say this. Two-in-ten independents (19%) say they followed election news very closely.
