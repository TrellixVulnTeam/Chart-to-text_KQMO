Teens are divided on whether they spend too much or too little time playing video games. A quarter of teens (26%) believe they spend too much time playing video games, while a similar share (22%) feels they spend too little time doing so. And as with video game playing in general, these findings differ by gender. Four-in-ten boys ages 13 to 17 (41%) say they spend too much time playing video games, nearly four times the share of girls who say the same (11%). And a larger share of boys (65%) than girls (50%) have cut back on the amount of time they spend playing games. Three-in-ten girls believe they spend too little time playing games, a view shared by just 14% of boys.
