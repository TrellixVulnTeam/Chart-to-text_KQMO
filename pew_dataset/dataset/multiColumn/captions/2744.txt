Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are twice as likely as Republicans and Republican leaners to say they support the federal government providing all Americans with a guaranteed income if computers and robots become widely competitive with humans (77% vs. 38%). Democrats are also substantially more likely than Republicans to favor a federally run service program for displaced workers (66% vs. 46%).
On other questions related to automation policies, there are smaller or no partisan differences. For example, large majorities in both parties (85% of Democrats and 86% of Republicans) say workforce automation should be primarily limited to jobs that are dangerous or unhealthy for humans to do. And about six-in-ten in each party (63% of Democrats and 61% of Republicans) support allowing consumers to pay extra to interact with a human when buying goods or services.
