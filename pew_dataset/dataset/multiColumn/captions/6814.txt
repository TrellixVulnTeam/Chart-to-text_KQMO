The controversy surrounding the firing of U.S. Department of Agriculture official Shirley Sherrod attracted widespread attention from the news media last week and was the dominant story on cable news networks. The public, however, showed modest interest in the Sherrod affair and, as has been the case since early May, the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico was by far the public’s most closely followed news story.
The latest News Interest Index survey, conducted July 22-25 among 1,004 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, finds that 51% say the oil leak was the story they followed most closely last week, compared with just 8% who cited news reports about the Sherrod controversy. News about the economy – at 13% most closely – also drew more interest than the Sherrod story.
A separate analysis by Pew Research’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ) finds that reports on Sherrod’s firing accounted for 14% of all coverage last week, but as much as 28% of coverage on July 21, after it became clear that the video posted by conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart took Sherrod’s comments about race out of context. The White House subsequently apologized to Sherrod, as did many news commentators.
