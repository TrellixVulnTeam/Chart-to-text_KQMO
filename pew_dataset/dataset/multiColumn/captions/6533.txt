Americans followed news about the verdict in the Casey Anthony murder trial more closely than other top stories by a wide margin last week, but they also kept a watch on news about the nation’s struggling economy and the talks in Washington over raising the federal debt limit.
Nearly four-in-ten (37%) say the Florida jury’s controversial verdict, which found Anthony not guilty of murdering her toddler daughter, was their top story of the week, according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey conducted July 7-10 among 1,007 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. Another 17% say they followed reports about the economy most closely, while 14% cite the deliberations over how to address the federal deficit and the national debt.
News about the economy and the debt limit debate together made up about a quarter of the newshole, according to the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). The debt debate accounted for 17% of coverage and the economy more generally 8%. The Anthony case made up 17% of coverage and Anthony was easily the week’s top newsmaker.
