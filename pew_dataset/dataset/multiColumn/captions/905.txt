Greece, for example, has been in the news a great deal over the past decade, from its debt crisis following the Great Recession to its role as a key entry point for refugees entering Europe. So how do Greeks feel about the way things are going in their country? As of 2019, just 16% say they are satisfied with the direction of their nation, while 82% say they are dissatisfied. (This is actually an improvement from 2016, when only 5% of Greeks expressed satisfaction with the way things were going in their country and 95% said they were dissatisfied.) Greeks’ attitudes toward the direction of the country track closely with their feelings about the economy: As of 2019, only 15% of Greeks say their nation’s economic situation is good, while 85% say it is bad. (This is again an improvement from 2016.)
