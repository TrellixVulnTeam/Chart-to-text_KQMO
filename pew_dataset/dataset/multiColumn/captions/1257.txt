Yet there are much wider differences in views of banning high-capacity ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and assault-style weapons. Nearly nine-in-ten Democrats favor each of these proposals, compared with about half of Republicans.
Still, support for banning high-capacity magazines has increased among members of both parties since 2017 (8 points among Democrats, 7 points among Republicans).
While more Democrats favor a ban on assault weapons now than did so two years ago, slightly fewer Republicans support such a ban than in 2017.
