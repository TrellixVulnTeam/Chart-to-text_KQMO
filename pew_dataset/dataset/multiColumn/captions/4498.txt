A close examination of the broadcast schedule suggests one reason why. Faced with multiple years of audience declines during traditional time slots – indeed, morning, early evening and late night news on local TV affiliates have lost on average 12% of their viewers since 2007 – many local TV stations began expanding their programming to nontraditional hours such as very early morning, midday and at 7 p.m., according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Nielsen data. These additions are finding at least some new audiences willing to tune in.
The 7 p.m. time slot carries special appeal for local stations as it immediately follows networks’ national news programs. In 2014, that time slot saw the biggest growth among the three nontraditional time slots studied here, enjoying an 11% increase from the year before. Over the past five years, newscasts on network affiliates in the 7 p.m. time slot have grown their audience by 8%.
