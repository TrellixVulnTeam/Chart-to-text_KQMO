The Federal Reserve Act gives the nation’s central bank two main tasks: maximize employment and maintain long-term price stability. While both are worthy goals, economists have known for a while that achieving both low inflation and maximum employment simultaneously is, at best, difficult (the relationship is a lot more complicated than the simple tradeoff often cited in the media).
The complex interplay between the Fed’s dual mandates is well captured in the spaghetti-bowl swirls of this New York Times chart, which covers more than eight decades of U.S. economic history. The twisting line traces average annual unemployment and core inflation (the Fed’s preferred measure, which excludes volatile food and energy categories) for each year since the onset of the Great Depression.
