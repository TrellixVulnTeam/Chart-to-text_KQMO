Although they comprise a relatively small share of the population, these workers who have been impacted by automation express strongly negative views about the current – and future – impact of technology on their own careers. Fully 46% of these workers feel that technology has decreased their own opportunities for career advancement, while 34% feel that technology has generally made their work less interesting (each of these views is shared by just 11% of other workers). And nearly six-in-ten (57%) anticipate that their own jobs or professions will be mostly done by machines within their lifetimes – roughly twice the share among workers who have not been impacted by automation in this way (28%).
More broadly, the survey also finds that the current generation of workforce technologies has had widely disparate impacts on today’s workers. For some – especially those with high levels of educational attainment – technology represents a largely positive force that makes their work more interesting and provides opportunities for career advancement. But those who have not attended college are much less likely to view today’s workforce technologies in such a positive light.
When it comes to the overall impact of technology on them in a professional context, just 38% of workers with high school diplomas or less indicate that technology in general has made their jobs more interesting. And a similarly modest share (32%) feels that technology has increased their opportunities for career advancement. In each instance, these figures are substantially lower than those reported by workers who have continued their formal education beyond high school.
