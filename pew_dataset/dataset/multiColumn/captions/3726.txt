First, split-ticket districts were overwhelmingly Republican for the presidency but Democratic when it came to the House (a combined 92.6% of all split-ticket districts in the five election cycles between 1972 and 1988). And second, tickets in Southern districts were far more likely to be split than those in any other region: Of all districts that split their presidential and House votes between 1972 and 1988, 41.2% were from Southern states even though the South accounted for just 31.5% of all House seats. This was well above the shares in any of the other three Census-defined regions. In 1972, two-thirds of all Southern districts split their presidential and House votes; as recently as 1988 more than half still did.
