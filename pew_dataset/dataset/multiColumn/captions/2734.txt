The Center’s survey found other indications that gun owners are more politically engaged than non-gun owners. For example, while only 16% of U.S. adults say they’ve ever given money to an organization that takes a position on gun policy, gun owners are again more likely than non-gun owners to say they have done so. Among gun owners, 28% say they have ever given money to an organization like this, including 12% of who have done so in the past year. The same is true for just 10% of non-owners, including 6% who have done so in the past year.
