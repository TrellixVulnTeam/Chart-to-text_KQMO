Regardless of whether they are formally registered with a church, people in countries with a mandatory church tax are more likely to self-identify as Christian than are people in Western European countries that do not have any church tax system. In four of the six countries with a mandatory church tax – Austria, Finland, Switzerland and Germany – roughly seven-in-ten or more adults identify as Christians. By contrast, in only two of the six countries surveyed that do not have a church tax – the UK and Ireland – does the share of Christians exceed seven-in-ten. And across Western Europe, the country with the smallest share of Christians (the Netherlands, 41%) does not have a church tax.
In some church tax countries, the share of people who identify as Christian generally is declining more slowly than in countries that do not have such taxes. In all 15 Western European countries surveyed, fewer people say they are currently Christian than say they were raised Christian. But the countries with the steepest drops in Christian identification – including Belgium, Norway and the Netherlands – do not have church taxes. And some of the countries with the smallest drops in Christian identification, such as Switzerland and Austria, do have a church tax.
