Hillary Clinton is hoping to make history on Tuesday by being elected the nation’s first woman president. While the impact of Clinton’s gender on her candidacy is viewed very differently by her supporters and voters who back Donald Trump, there also is a gender gap among Clinton’s supporters.
Half of Clinton supporters think she is being held to a higher standard than past presidential candidates because she is a woman; just 11% of Trump supporters say the same, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Oct. 20-25.
But women who back Clinton are far more likely than her male supporters to say she is being held to a higher standard. A majority of women who back Clinton (57%) express this view, compared with 34% who say her gender is not a factor.
Among men who back Clinton, opinion is nearly the reverse: 52% say Clinton’s gender is not a factor, while 40% say she is held to a higher standard than prior presidential candidates. Very few of Clinton’s male (6%) or female (8%) supporters think she is treated less critically because of her gender.
