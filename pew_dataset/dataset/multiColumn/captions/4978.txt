Sharing ideas: In addition, 72% of internet users say digital technologies have improved their ability to share their ideas and creations with others. These figures have risen since 2006, when we found that 55% of online adults felt the internet improved their ability to share their ideas and creations. It is likely that a major contributor to the increase in this measurement is the rise of social networking sites, which were not heavily in use in in 2006. Social networking sites are used by more than two-thirds of those who go online now.
