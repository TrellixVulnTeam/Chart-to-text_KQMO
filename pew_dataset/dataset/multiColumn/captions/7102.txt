More than four-in-ten Americans (44%) say they followed reports about the U.S. economy very closely last week, which is little changed from recent weeks. News organizations, meanwhile, devoted 12% of the newshole to the economic crisis, as measured by PEJ. That figure does not include 5% of coverage devoted to new credit card regulations enacted into law last week in Washington. Interest in that story was measured separately in this survey.
Public attention to economic news peaked as the financial crisis deepened last fall. In the last week of September, 70% said they were following economic news very closely â€“ the highest ever in a Pew Research survey. Since then, interest has fluctuated depending on events; this year, interest peaked at 57% in late January.
