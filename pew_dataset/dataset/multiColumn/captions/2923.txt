Japanese and South Koreans expect the U.S. to come to their aid in the event of a conflict with North Korea â€“ and Americans support such a move. Two close neighbors of North Korea, Japan and South Korea, are also U.S. treaty allies, meaning that if North Korea used military force against them, the U.S. would be obligated to defend them. In both countries, large majorities expect this would happen: 91% of South Koreans expect U.S. assistance in the event of a military conflict with North Korea, and 82% of Japanese say the same. Nearly two-thirds of Americans (64%) say the U.S. should use military force to defend its allies in Asia in the event that they get into a serious military conflict with North Korea.
