A new poll finds that the public is as interested in the Supreme Court’s upcoming ruling on the Voting Rights Act as in its long-awaited decisions on same-sex marriage.
Roughly a third of Americans (35% each) say they are very interested in both how the court will rule on whether parts of the Voting Rights Act are still necessary and on federal and state laws on gay marriage.
A third (33%) express little or no interest in how the court rules on the Voting Rights Act, while 40% say they are not too or not at all interested in the court’s rulings on gay marriage.
The Pew Research Center survey was conducted June 20-23 among 1,005 adults, before the Supreme Court’s ruling Monday on affirmative action in college admissions. About three-in-ten (31%) had said they were very interested in that decision.
