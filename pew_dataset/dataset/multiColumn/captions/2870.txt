In late October, just prior to the election, only 11% of Republicans and Republican leaners said they were satisfied with how things were going, while 52% of Democrats and Democratic leaners said they were satisfied. Today, these views are nearly the reverse: 49% of Republicans now say they are satisfied, while just 11% of Democrats agree.
As has been noted previously, it is typical for partisans’ views of national satisfaction to shift following a change in party control of the White House, but the size of the shift among both Republicans and Democrats is more pronounced than it was in either 2001, shortly after the election of George W. Bush and 2009, following Obama’s election.
