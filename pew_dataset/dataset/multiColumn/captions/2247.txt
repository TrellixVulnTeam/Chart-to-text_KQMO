Yet most of these users did not tweet about immigration regularly. On average, the large majority (84%) of those who tweeted about immigration with a link did so just once a week or less during the period studied. In contrast, a smaller core tweeted daily or more – 14% of users in this dataset shared a tweet about immigration with a link daily, on average, with another 2% doing so semi-daily (more than once per day, but less than hourly), and fewer than 1% posting hourly, on average.
As a result, the large majority of users who tweeted weekly or less did not have a large impact on the overall volume of tweets about immigration that contained a link, producing only about a quarter of them (26%). Instead, the users who produced the most tweets were those who tweeted daily (32% of tweets). Semi-daily and hourly users each produced about one-in-five of them (20% and 19%, respectively). (These user types – also referred to as tweeters – are used throughout the rest of the post.)
