In views of the Supreme Court’s ideology, the overall pattern of opinion was similar, though there were some differences in the point estimates between the online and telephone surveys: Far fewer adults today said the court was liberal than said this for much of the last decade. This includes declining shares of Republicans and Democrats who expressed this view.
As has been true for the last several years, more adults said the Supreme Court is “middle of the road” than conservative or liberal. Still, in both the phone and online surveys, larger shares said the Supreme Court was conservative than liberal.
