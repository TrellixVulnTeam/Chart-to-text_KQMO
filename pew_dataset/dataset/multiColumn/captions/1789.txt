As Latino attitudes toward the number of immigrants living in the U.S. have changed, an age gap in these views has emerged. In the 2018 survey, Latinos ages 18 to 29 were 13 percentage points less likely than those 30 and older to say there are too many immigrants in the U.S. In 2002, by comparison, there was virtually no age gap.
