Google search activity for specific gun models tends to rise and fall in a similar pattern to the number of background checks conducted by the FBI. When we examined monthly, nationwide Google searches for the gun models on our list between February 2012 and February 2018, as well as the adjusted number of gun background checks the FBI carried out each month during this period, we found a strong correlation between the two. This finding aligns with other research that has found that Google search activity tends to track real-world economic indicators closely. A 2017 paper published in the journal Science also found that the search term “buy gun” is strongly correlated with background checks.
Google search interest in guns is correlated with the population-adjusted number of FBI background checks at the state level, too. In 2017, states with more Google search activity for the specific gun models we tested also had a higher per-capita number of FBI background checks. (This finding reflects Google searches and background checks conducted over the course of the full year.)
