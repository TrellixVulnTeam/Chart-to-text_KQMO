While large majorities of Americans (73% in a recent Pew Research Center survey) support raising the minimum wage, there’s less agreement on what it should be raised to. In the same survey, only 11% said the federal hourly minimum should be $15 or more; most of those favoring an increase didn’t think the minimum should be higher than $10.99.
