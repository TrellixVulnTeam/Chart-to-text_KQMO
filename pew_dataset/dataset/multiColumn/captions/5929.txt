Republicans see benefits – as well as costs – from legalization. Our June survey found that a large majority of Republicans (70%) think it would be better for the U.S. economy if undocumented immigrants became legal workers. About as many (69%) said undocumented immigrants are “hard workers who should have an opportunity to stay” in the United States.” And fully 76% say it would be unrealistic to deport everyone in the country illegally.
Yet substantial percentages of Republicans also see potential downsides from granting undocumented immigrants legal status: 77% say it would encourage more people to come to the U.S. illegally and 68% think it would reward illegal behavior. Most also say legalization would drain government services (68%) and cost U.S. jobs (66%).
