Republicans and Democrats differ substantially in views of how most of these groups will fare during Trump’s presidency. Sizable majorities of Democrats say a number of groups will lose influence with Trump in the White House: 81% say the influence of the poor will decline; 78% say the same about Hispanics; 74% each say women and gays and lesbians will lose influence; and 73% say this about blacks.
No more than about a third of Republicans say any of these groups will lose influence with Trump in the White House (33% gays and lesbians, 32% Hispanics). Most Republicans expect that these groups will either gain influence or not be affected by Trump’s presidency.
On the other hand, 83% of Democrats expect wealthy people to gain influence in Trump’s presidency, while close to two-thirds say the influence of men (65%) and whites (64%) will grow. By contrast, only about four-in-ten Republicans anticipate that the influence of these groups will increase (43% wealthy people, 40% whites, 36% men).
