Public perceptions of the tone of economic news have become much less negative over the past month. In fact, the percentage saying they are hearing mostly bad news about the economy has dropped to its lowest point since the question was first asked in December 2008.
Currently, 24% say they are hearing mostly bad news, down 15 points from 39% in early December. The proportion saying they are hearing a mix of good and bad news has jumped from 55% last month to 68% in the new survey. However, as has been the case for the past two years, very few say they are hearing mostly good economic news; just 7% say this, which is little changed from 4% in December.
