Whites, blacks and Hispanics all have experienced substantial increases in fatal drug overdose deaths in recent years, but there has been an especially large rise among blacks. The overdose death rate for black Americans rose 40% between 2015 and 2016, from 12.2 deaths per 100,000 people to 17.1 per 100,000. Among black men in urban counties, specifically, the fatality rate rose 50% â€“ from 22.6 deaths per 100,000 people in 2015 to 34.0 per 100,000 a year later.
Despite the sharp year-over-year increase among blacks, whites continue to have a substantially higher overall drug overdose death rate (25.3 per 100,000) than both blacks (17.1 per 100,000) and Hispanics (9.5 per 100,000).
