The Pew Research survey asked a question about the role of astronauts in the future as part of space exploration: “The cost of sending human astronauts to space is considerably greater than the cost of using robotic machines for space exploration. As you think about the future of the U.S. space program, do you think it is essential or not essential to include the use of human astronauts in space?”
A majority of the public (59%) says astronauts are essential to include in the future of the U.S. space program, while 39% say astronauts are not essential. By contrast, 52% of AAAS scientists say astronauts are not essential and 47% say they are essential.
Men are a bit more likely than women to consider astronauts essential in the future of the U.S. space program. There are no differences in views about this issue by age, race and ethnicity, or education.
