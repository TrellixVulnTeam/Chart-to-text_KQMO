Debt-to-income ratios have increased for young student debtors, even as they have declined for other young households since 2008. The typical young, college-educated student debtor household has debts equivalent to two years of income. Young, college-educated households with no student debt and less-educated households with student debt carry half this debt load, or the equivalent of one year of income.
