Moderate and liberal Republicans are far more likely than conservative Republicans – who make up about two-thirds of all Republicans and GOP leaners – to say Trump has probably done something illegal or unethical. A majority of moderate and liberal Republicans (57%) say it is definite or probable that Trump has behaved unethically; fewer conservative Republicans (36%) say the same.
