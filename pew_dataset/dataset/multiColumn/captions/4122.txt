With the Federal Reserve raising interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade, views of the institution are not immune from todayâ€™s politically polarized climate. In 2014, roughly half of Americans (47%) had a favorable opinion of the Fed and 37% had an unfavorable view. But Republicans, especially conservative Republicans, were more likely to view the institution unfavorably.
Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents expressed favorable opinions of the Fed by a roughly two-to-one margin (57% vs. 28%). Only 39% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said the same, while nearly half (48%) expressed an unfavorable opinion.
Among conservative Republicans, 54% viewed the Fed unfavorably, while just a third had a favorable opinion. Moderate and liberal Republicans were more likely than conservatives to view the Fed favorably (47%).
