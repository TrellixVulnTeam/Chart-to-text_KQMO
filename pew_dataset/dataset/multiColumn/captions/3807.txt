Additionally, blacks as compared with whites, and those living in the South and Northeast are more inclined to see Zika as a threat to public health. Some 46% of blacks, compared with 27% of whites, believe Zika is a major threat to the population. (The 39% of Hispanics saying Zika is a major threat is not statistically different than the share saying the same among either blacks or whites.) These findings are in line with previous surveys showing a higher level of concern among blacks about some health issues, particularly about experimental-health matters.
There were also regional differences about the level of threat Zika poses. Some 39% of Northeasterners and 35% of Southerners believe the Zika virus is a major threat to the American population, compared with 21% of Westerners and 28% of Midwesterners who say they think the threat level is high.
