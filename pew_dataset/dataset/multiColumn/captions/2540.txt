There is a strong relationship between age and television news habits. Younger adults are less likely than older adults to often get news via all three TV platforms. For example, just 8% of those ages 18 to 29 often get news from network TV, compared with 49% of those 65 and older.
Education and income also play a role in local and network TV news consumption habits. For instance, among adults who have completed college, 26% often get news from local TV and 21% from network TV â€“ much less than those with no more than a high school degree (47% and 31%, respectively). News use on cable varies little by education or income, however.
