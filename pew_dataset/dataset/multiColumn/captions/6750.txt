While many publics around the world continue to believe the U.S. acts unilaterally in world affairs, Indians see a more multilateral America. More than eight-in-ten (83%) say the U.S. takes the interests of countries like India into account when it makes foreign policy decisions – the highest percentage among the 21 nations surveyed outside the U.S. This view has become increasingly common among Indians over the last eight years – in 2002, only 51% said the U.S. considered their interests.
