As a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico spread toward the Louisiana coastline last week, the public focused on the unfolding story of a potential environmental disaster.
About four-in-ten (41%) say this was the story they followed most closely last week, much greater than the 21% that say they most closely followed news about Arizona’s controversial new law targeting illegal immigrants. When asked what story they were talking about with friends, 26% mention the Gulf Coast oil spill, while 12% offer the debate over the new Arizona immigration law, according to the latest News Interest Index survey conducted April 30-May 3 among 1,011 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press.
For its part, the media devoted the bulk of coverage last week to these stories and the economy. The oil spill and the immigration debate each made up 16% of the newshole analyzed by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism. Meanwhile, economic news totaled 24% of coverage, with the largest shares devoted to coverage of Goldman Sachs and allegations of fraud against the company (9%), the debate over strengthening Wall Street regulation (6%) and the economic crisis in Greece (3% of newshole). Other economic news made up another 6% of coverage.
