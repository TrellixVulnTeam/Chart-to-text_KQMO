Overall, 69% of white internet users said they had visited video-sharing sites, 13 points higher than in April 2009, and more than double the 31% reported when the question was first asked in December 2006.2 At the same time, 79% of online non-whites — African-Americans, Hispanics and others – reported using video-sharing sites. That figure is 12 points higher than April 2009, and 41 points higher than in 2006.
