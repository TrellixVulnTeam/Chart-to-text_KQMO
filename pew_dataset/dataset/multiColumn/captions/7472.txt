The collapse of Utah’s Crandall Canyon Mine that trapped six mine workers and led to a major rescue effort topped the public’s news interest last week. Overall, nearly three-in-ten Americans (28%) said it was the story they followed more closely than any other. The coal mining accident shared the public’s attention for the most closely followed story of the week with the war in Iraq (16% most closely) and the 2008 presidential campaign (11%). U.S. economic conditions (9%), hot weather (8%), and the Barry Bonds record (7%) each was cited by fewer than one-in-ten Americans.
