Despite souring public sentiment about their domestic economy and some concern about Japan’s declining role on the world stage, the Japanese are outward looking. They believe that involvement in the global economy is good for the country and that Japan should help other nations, particularly developing ones, deal with their problems.
Nevertheless, nearly six-in-ten say international trade and investment is good for Japan because it creates new market opportunities and boosts growth. Roughly the same share of the public believes that Japan needs to assist other nations with their problems. Majorities want to increase investment in, trade with, and foreign aid to developing countries. And about half say Japan should take its allies’ concerns into account when making Japanese foreign policy.
