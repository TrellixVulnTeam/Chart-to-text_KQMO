Every two years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics makes a projection of what the nation’s workforce will look like 10 years into the future. Its latest projection, released last month, foresees an America in which more people work longer into their older years. By 2022, the agency projects that 31.9% of those ages 65 to 74 will still be working. That compares with 20.4% of the same age bracket in the workforce in 2002 and 26.8% who were in the workforce in 2012.
The agency’s data finds the dividing line is age 55: labor force participation is expected to fall for those under that age who are considered the prime workforce group, and to rise for those above that age.
There is less of an increase projected for 55-to-64 year olds. In 2002, 61.9% of Americans in this age group were in the workforce, a number that increased to 64.5% in 2012. The 2022 projection is that 67.5% will remain in the workforce.
