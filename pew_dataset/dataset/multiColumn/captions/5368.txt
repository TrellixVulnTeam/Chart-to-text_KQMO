Fewer Egyptians now say that democracy is preferable to any other form of government than in surveys following the Arab Spring, and for the first time, more say that stability is a priority over democracy. While 45% of the population says that honest elections with the choice of at least two political parties are very important for Egyptâ€™s future, that number is down 11 percentage points from 2013.
