While views vary in the region on whether China acts too unilaterally in foreign affairs, its growing military power has caused concern among its Asian-Pacific neighbors. About seven-in-ten or more in Japan, South Korea, Australia and the Philippines regard China’s increasing military might as a bad thing, with that view held by 96% in Japan and 91% in South Korea. There is less concern in Pakistan (5%), Malaysia (20%), and Indonesia (39%), although the number of people in those countries who see China’s military power as a positive thing is down from previous surveys.
