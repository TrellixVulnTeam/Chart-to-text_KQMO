The public’s views of news about the overall economy have improved since last month: 60% say they are hearing mixed news, while 33% say the news is mostly bad and 5% say the economic news is mostly good. Last month, 38% said the news was mostly bad. But in January, just 24% said news about the economy was mostly bad.
Perceptions of economic news have fluctuated since mid-2009 – along with the ups and downs of an economy struggling to recover. During the first half of 2010, about two-thirds of the public said they were hearing a mix of good and bad economic news, but then perceptions grew more negative as the recovery stalled.
In January, 68% said they were hearing mixed economic news while just 24% said the news was mostly bad. By March, just 53% said they were hearing mixed news and 38% said they were hearing mostly bad news. In the new survey, 60% say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy while 33% say the news is mostly bad.
