Nearly six-in-ten U.S. adults (59%) say the government should do more to solve problems, compared with about four-in-ten (39%) who say government is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals.
The share who say government should do more to solve problems has increased slightly, by 4 percentage points, since September 2019. The share who say this is 12 points higher than it was in April 2015.
While two-thirds of Republicans (66%) say that government is doing too many things better left to businesses and individuals, the share of Republicans and Republican leaners who say government should do more to solve problems has increased – from 23% to 32% – since 2015.
Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, the share who say government should do more to solve problems has increased from about two-thirds (68%) in 2015 to about eight-in-ten (82%) today.
