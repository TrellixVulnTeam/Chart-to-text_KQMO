More than four-in-ten (43%) say they followed news about Obama’s decision to send more troops to Afghanistan very closely, an interest level comparable to mid-2002. Throughout 2009, the percentage following Afghanistan news very closely often stood in the mid-20s. Two-in-ten (20%) say this was the story they followed most closely last week, higher than any other week this year – but still below the 29% that say they followed the debate over health care legislation most closely.
According to the Pew Research Center’s latest weekly News Interest Index, conducted Dec. 4-7 among 1,003 adults, 10% say the evolving Tiger Woods scandal was the story they followed most closely. About two-in-ten (19%) say they followed the Woods story very closely; another 27% say they followed this news fairly closely.
A separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism found that coverage of the war in Afghanistan was the top story of last week, accounting for 27% of the newshole, while the economy accounted for 14% of coverage. Woods’ troubles made up 6% of the newshole, while stories about Tareq and Michaele Salahis’ ability to get past White House security took up another 6%. With senators negotiating health care legislation largely behind closed doors, that story made up 5% of the newshole.
