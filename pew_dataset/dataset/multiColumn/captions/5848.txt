A 2012 Pew Research Center survey found that roughly half of Americans (51%) say that a gay or lesbian person’s sexual orientation cannot be changed, while 36% say it can be changed. In 2003, opinion on this question was divided, with 42% saying one’s sexual orientation can be changed and an equal share (42%) saying it cannot.
