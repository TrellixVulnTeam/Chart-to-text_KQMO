The seven columns on the left side of the chart show how the white share of the vote for president has steadily declined over the past quarter century. The two columns on the right show the racial composition of the population now and in 2060, as projected by the Census Bureau.
A couple of patterns stand out. First, whites were 74% of voters last year at a time when they were just 63% of the population. This racial turnout gap is driven by the fact that a disproportionate share of non-whites are either too young to vote, not eligible to vote (because they’re not citizens), or just don’t vote. All of these factors could change over time.
