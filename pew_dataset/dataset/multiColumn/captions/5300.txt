As leaders from the U.S. and China meet this week in Beijing to discuss a range of economic and political issues, Americans are more likely to support stronger economic ties with China than a tougher approach.
About half of Americans (51%) say it is more important to build a stronger relationship with China on economic issues, while 41% say it is more important to get tougher with China, according to a poll conducted Feb. 12-26 among 3,337 adults. This data was released in the Pew Research Centerâ€™s political typology study on June 26.
Two years ago, the balance of opinion was the opposite. Nearly half (49%) of Americans in 2012 said it was more important to get tougher with China, while fewer (42%) viewed a stronger relationship as more important.
