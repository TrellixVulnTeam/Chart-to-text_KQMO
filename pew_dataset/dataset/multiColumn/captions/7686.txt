Americans broadly support the disaster relief effort, but there is no evidence that basic attitudes on poverty ­ and the government’s role in addressing the issue ­ have been altered by Katrina. Currently, a narrow 51% majority expresses the view that poor people have hard lives because government benefits don’t go far enough to help them live decently; 38% think poor people have it easy because they can get government benefits without doing anything in return.
