Most people vote, but they participate in relatively few other political activities. Whether they are required to by national law or they do so out of civic duty, most people in emerging and developing countries vote. A median of 78% say they have voted at some point, more than double the amount of any other political activity tested, including attending campaign events and protesting. Participation in online political activities is low â€“ just 7% say they have posted links to political articles and 9% have posted online political comments.
