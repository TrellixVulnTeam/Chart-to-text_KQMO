Americans who prefer to get their local news in print are much more likely to pay for it than those who prefer other platforms. About four-in-ten of these news consumers (39%) say they have paid for local news in the past year. That is more than double the share among those who prefer to get news either from the radio (16%) or news websites or apps (12%), and around four times the share of those who prefer to get local news from TV (10%). It also far exceeds the share among those who prefer to get local news via social media (8%).
Print news consumers are also more pessimistic about the financial well-being of their local news media when compared with most other groups. Almost six-in-ten print consumers (63%) think their local news media outlets are doing well financially, 15 percentage points lower than the share among those who prefer TV for local news (77%). Those who prefer radio are about on par with those who prefer print, while those who prefer digital platforms fall in between.
