Veterans who have served in the post-9/11 era have a more positive view than the general public about the overall worth of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars and the tactics the military has used to wage them. Even so, in a Pew Research Center survey conducted in 2011, only one-third (34%) of these recent veterans said that both wars have been worth fighting; nearly as many (33%) said neither conflict had been worth the costs.
However, despite those mixed views and the hardships veterans have endured in the service and in their re-entry into civilian life, they have positive views of their experience.
