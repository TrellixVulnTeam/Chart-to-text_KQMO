Large increases in mobile news use have also occurred among those with lower household incomes. About eight-in-ten adults with household incomes below $30,000 (79%) get news on mobile, double the portion of those who did so four years ago (37%). Even so, this is still lower than those with higher household incomes: About nine-in-ten of those with household incomes of $30,000 or more now get news on a mobile device.
