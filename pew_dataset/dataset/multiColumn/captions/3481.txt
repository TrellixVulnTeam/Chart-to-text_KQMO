Whites, as well as college graduates and those with higher incomes, are more likely than nonwhites to have spoken with or been interviewed by a local journalist, according to a survey by Pew Research Center.
About three-in-ten whites (29%) say they have ever spoken with or been interviewed by a local journalist or reporter, compared with 19% of nonwhites. (Nonwhite includes all racial and ethnic groups except non-Hispanic white.) This difference is particularly striking given that nonwhites generally are more engaged consumers of local news than whites. For instance, while 43% of nonwhites follow local news very closely, only a third of whites say the same – a similar pattern to what we found in our 2015 study of local news habits in three cities.
Experiences in talking to local journalists also differ starkly by respondents’ level of education. Those with a college degree are twice as likely to have spoken with a local journalist as those who have never been to college. Just over a third (36%) of those with at least a college degree say they have spoken with a local reporter, compared with 23% of those with some college education and 18% of those with a high school diploma or less. A similar pattern is evident when considering Americans’ income levels, with those earning $75,000 or more per year being most likely to have been interviewed by a local journalist.
