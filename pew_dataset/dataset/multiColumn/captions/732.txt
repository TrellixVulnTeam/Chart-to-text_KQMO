Overall, nearly one-in-five Americans (17%) say they have lost their job as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, and about a quarter of Americans (23%) say they had to take a cut in pay due to reduced hours or demand for their work; 10% of Americans say they experienced both a pay cut and job loss. About one-in-five say someone else in their immediate household lost their job (18%) or lost wages (22%). In total, 43% of Americans say they or someone in their household has lost a job or wages.
Job and wage losses continue to be felt more acutely by some groups than others. Hispanic adults (43%) – particularly those born outside the U.S. – are among the most likely to say they’ve personally experienced pay cuts or job loss due to the coronavirus outbreak, as are those ages 18 to 29 (40%), adults with lower incomes (36%) and those with a high school degree or less (33%). These patterns mirror previous findings, when the questions were asked in a somewhat different format.
