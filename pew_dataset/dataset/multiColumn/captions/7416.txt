The campaign was also a top news story last week. Roughly a quarter of the public (24%) followed campaign news very closely and 22% listed this as their most closely followed story of the week.
The Iraq war, which has been the public’s most closely followed news story throughout much of the year, has nearly fallen off the media’s radar screen. Last week, the national media devoted 2% of its overall coverage to events in Iraq making it the ninth most heavily covered news story of the week. The previous week the war received 3% of the national news coverage, placing it eighth overall. In spite of reduced coverage, the public is still following events in Iraq fairly closely, illustrating the continuing importance the public places on the story. Last week, 28% of Americans paid very close attention to news about the current situation and events in Iraq and 13% listed this as their most closely followed news story.
