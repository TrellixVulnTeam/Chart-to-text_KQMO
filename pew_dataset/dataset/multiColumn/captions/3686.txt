In the second experiment, all consenting respondents received text message and email invitations to their surveys. Those who had not responded by the third day were randomized into either the treatment group, which received text and email reminders, or the control group, which received only email reminders. Reminders were sent on days 4, 9, and 15 of the field period.
The respondents who received only email reminders but still answered the survey were younger than the respondents who received both text and email reminders. Of the email-only group, one quarter (25%) were ages 18 to 29 versus only 15% of the text and email group. This was unexpected because of the popularity of texting among this age group. One possible explanation is that younger people use text messaging more than older adults, so the text message reminders may have been less novel. There were no other differences in demographics between the two groups of respondents.
