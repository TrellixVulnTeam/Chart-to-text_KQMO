When asked whether it is acceptable in Islam to visit shrines of Muslim saints, Iraqi Muslims are split along sectarian lines, with Shias nearly unanimous in their approval (98%), compared with roughly two-thirds of Sunnis (65%) who say it is acceptable.
Likewise, in neighboring Iran, the vast majority of Iranian Shias (89%) say it is acceptable to visit shrines of saints, but only 28% of Sunnis agree. In some countries with very few Shias, Sunni Muslims are even less accepting of such practices: as few as 4% of Egyptian Sunnis and 3% of Jordanian Sunnis say visiting shrines is permissible.
