More whites favor an active U.S. presence in world affairs than blacks or Hispanics. About half of white Americans (49%) say its best for the country to be active in world affairs, but just 39% of Hispanics and 29% of blacks say the same.
More educated Americans are the most supportive of an active U.S. presence on the world stage. A strong majority of those with a postgraduate degree (66%) say the U.S. should be active globally, compared to 29% saying it should concentrate on domestic problems. Those who have a four-year college degree are more narrowly divided, but a majority favors an active U.S. global role (56% active vs. 40% pay less attention).
Americans who have not completed college tend to favor paying less attention to problems overseas and concentrating here at home. Larger shares of those with some college experience (52% vs. 38%) and those with a high school degree or less (56% vs. 39%) say we should pay less attention overseas than say itâ€™s best to be active in world affairs.
Whites without a college degree are skeptical of an active U.S. presence in world affairs. About half of whites without a college degree (51%) say the U.S. should pay less attention to problems overseas. Most whites with a college degree take the opposite view (64% say U.S. should be active in world affairs); only a third say we should pay less attention to international problems.
