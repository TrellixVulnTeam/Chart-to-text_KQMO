Those who had their computers fail most recently were equally likely to fix it themselves as they were to contact user support for help (29%), but they were significantly less likely than those with internet connection or cell phone failures to contact user support. Some 45% of those with internet failure and 43% of those with cell phone problems contacted user support, compared with 29% of those with computer problems to do so.
Some 15% of all technology users with failed devices fixed the problem with help from family or friends, and those with computer (18%) and internet (15%) failures were significantly more likely than those with cell phone problems (7%) to get help from family or friends.
Cell phones were the device least likely to be fixed, as nearly one-fourth (23%) of those with broken cell phones were unable to fix problems they had with their cell phones. Some 19% of those with broken computers reported not being able to fix their computers, while significantly fewer were left without internet (7%). Put another way, while 77% of cell phone owners were successful fixing their phones when they broke, 93% of those whose home internet connection failed were able to fix it.
When a home internet connection fails, broadband may be trickier to fix than dial-up without help from customer support. Based on those who reported a failed home internet connection, broadband users were much more likely to seek user support for help (49% v. 27%). The problems, however, were equally likely to be fixed, with just 6% of dial-up users and 7% of broadband users unable to fix the problem.
