In addition to being dissatisfied with their political system, a median of 64% across the 34 emerging and developing nations surveyed say that higher-income people have too much influence in their political system. Just 15% say that those with high incomes do not have enough political power, and 11% say they have the right amount. In contrast, most think middle- and lower-income people have too little influence on politics. A median of 56% say that middle-income people do not have enough power, while 60% say this about those with lower incomes.
