While the media provided heavy coverage of the congressional elections last week, the public continued to track news about the nationâ€™s struggling economy more closely than news about the midterm vote.
About four-in-ten (41%) say they followed news about the economy very closely last week, while 30% say they followed news about the elections very closely, according to the latest News Interest Index survey of 1,006 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. By another measure, 24% say they followed news about the economy more closely than any other major story; 20% say they followed news about the elections most closely.
