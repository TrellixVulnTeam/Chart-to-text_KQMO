A Pew Research Center survey, conducted Sept. 1-4, 2016, among 1,004 adults (including 815 registered voters), asked voters which of five key issues would be most important in their vote for president. The economy tops the list, with 37% of registered voters saying this will be the most important issue for them. An additional 18% choose health care and 14% say terrorism. Immigration and gun policy are each named by 13% of voters.
When asked specifically about national economic issues, the job situation shares top billing with the budget deficit in terms of issues that voters say are important to their choice for president. Among the six economic issues tested, 43% of voters say that jobs will be either the most important or the second most important issue to their vote for president; 43% give the same weight to the federal budget deficit. By comparison, other economic issues – tax reform, income inequality, rising prices and global trade – are viewed as less important to voters.
