The median adjusted monthly household income of households headed by a young adult with a bachelor’s degree has increased by about $1,300 in inflation-adjusted dollars from 1984 ($5,960) to 2009 ($7,232). Household income gains have been even greater among households with advanced degrees (up $1,500 for those headed by a 25- to 34-year-old with a master’s degree and up $3,400 for young adult heads with a professional or doctorate degree).
