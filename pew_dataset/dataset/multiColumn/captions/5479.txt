In general, public support for the death penalty has tracked rates of violent crime, as calculated by the FBI. (The FBI has long compiled and reported uniform crime statistics, although not all local law enforcement agencies participate and some people have challenged the way they classify and report crimes.) The agency defines violent crimes as murder, non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault.
