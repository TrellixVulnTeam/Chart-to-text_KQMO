Republican men are particularly resistant to the idea of boys playing with toys and participating in activities that are typically associated with girls. About six-in-ten Republican men (61%) say itâ€™s a bad thing for parents to encourage young boys to do this, while just 38% say this is a good thing. In contrast, a majority of Republican women (58%) see this as a good approach for raising boys.
