With a deadline fast approaching and talk of serious economic consequences without congressional action, the standoff in Washington over raising the debt limit was the top story last week for both the public and the news media.
Currently, 38% say they followed news about the debt limit debate very closely, little different from the 34% that said this one week earlier according to the latest Weekly News Interest Index survey, conducted July 21-24 among 999 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The survey was conducted before the prime-time speeches on July 25 by President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner.
About a quarter (27%) cited the deficit and debt talks as their most closely followed story this week, while 20% cited news about the economy and 18% mentioned the intense heat wave sweeping much of the nation. The stalemate over raising the debt ceiling was more dominant in terms of news coverage, accounting for 29% of the newshole, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Centerâ€™s Project for Excellence in Journalism. The next most heavily covered story, at 17% of all coverage, was the British press scandal, which has attracted little public interest.
