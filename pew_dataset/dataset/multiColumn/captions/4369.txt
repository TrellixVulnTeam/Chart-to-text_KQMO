Grandparents who live with their grandchildren are more racially and ethnically diverse than the U.S. population overall, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data. Less than half (48%) of grandparents with grandchildren at home are white, while 75% of Americans overall ages 50 and older are white. Meanwhile, Hispanics, blacks and Asians make up a larger share of grandparents with grandchildren at home than they do of the 50+ population overall.
