If friendship is viewed as a step that could lead to marriage, it is easy to see why most Israelis say they oppose intermarriage. The vast majority of Jews (98%), Muslims (85%), Christians (86%) and Druze (83%) say that all or most of their close friends belong to their own religious community. Perhaps in part because they make up small percentages of Israelâ€™s population, Muslims, Christians and Druze are more likely than Jews to say at least some of their close friends are from another group.
