And even as the mood in Europe brightens, the euro crisis has left a challenging political legacy: the rise of Eurosceptic political parties on both the left and the right. When asked about leading nontraditional political parties, half or more of the publics in four of the six EU nations surveyed believe that these parties are good for their country because they raise important issues that are ignored by traditional parties. This is especially true in France, where among those who say the Eurosceptic party National Front is a good thing, people have a more negative view of the EU and think the European project has weakened France.
