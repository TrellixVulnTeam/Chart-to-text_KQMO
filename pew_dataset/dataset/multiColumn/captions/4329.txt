Several recent surveys have tracked growing dissatisfaction within the Republican Party. Our July survey found that positive views of the GOP among Republicans had declined 18 percentage points since January, from 86% to 68%. By contrast, 86% of Democrats viewed their party favorably.
Republicans had much to celebrate after capturing both the House and Senate in the 2014 midterm elections, but their opinion of GOP congressional leaders soured during the first months of the new term. In May, Republicansâ€™ approval of the performance of their leaders on the Hill fell to 41%, and just 37% said the leaders were keeping their campaign promises. By contrast, in April 1995, after the GOP had recaptured both chambers of Congress for the first time in four decades, fully 80% of Republicans said that their leaders were keeping their promises. Three-quarters of Republicans surveyed in May said their representatives in Congress should challenge President Obama more.
