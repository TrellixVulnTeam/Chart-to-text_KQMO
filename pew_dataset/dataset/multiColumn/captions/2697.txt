Among Republicans and Republican leaners, a wide majority of those with household incomes of $75,000 a year or more (73%) think lowering taxes on corporations and large businesses would help the economy. By comparison, 42% of Republicans in households making $30,000 a year or less think lower taxes for large businesses and corporations would help the economy.
Among Democrats and Democratic leaners, the income pattern in views is the reverse: Those with higher incomes are more likely than those with lower incomes to say tax cuts for large businesses and corporations would hurt the economy. About six-in-ten Democrats with incomes of $75,000 a year or more (61%) think lowering taxes on corporations would hurt the economy, compared with 44% of those earning $30,000 a year or less.
While Democrats overall think lower taxes on large businesses and corporations would make the tax system less fair, this view is more widely held among those earning $75,000 a year or more (76%) and those earning between $30,000 and $74,999 (61%) than among those with household incomes of less than $30,000 (45%). Among Republicans, those with incomes of $75,000 a year or above are more likely to say lowering taxes on large businesses and corporations would make the tax system more fair (43%) than less fair (17%).
