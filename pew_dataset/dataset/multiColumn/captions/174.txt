Trump voters, who already were skeptical of the electoral process and prospects for an accurate vote count before the election in October, have become much more so since Bidenâ€™s victory. While a 59% majority of all voters say elections in the United States were run and administered well, just 21% of Trump supporters have a positive view of how elections were administered nationally. Among Biden supporters, 94% say the elections were run and administered well.
