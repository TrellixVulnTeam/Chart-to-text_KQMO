Among Democrats, however, there are differences across demographic traits, especially when it comes to education and age. About three-in-ten Democrats with at least a college degree (29%) feel misunderstood by the news media, compared with 42% of those with some college education and 47% of those with a high school diploma or less. Democrats ages 50 and older are also less likely to feel misunderstood than those under age 50 (35% vs. 44%).
