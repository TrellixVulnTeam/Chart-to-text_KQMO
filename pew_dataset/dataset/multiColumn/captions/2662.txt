About seven-in-ten Americans (69%) now say they approve of the U.S. military campaign against Islamic militants in Iraq and Syria, and 55% say it is going very (13%) or fairly (42%) well. While clear majorities of the public have approved of the efforts to defeat ISIS since the campaign began, this is the first time in Pew Research Center surveys that a majority of the public views the military campaign in positive terms. As recently as last October, just 31% of Americans said the campaign was going very or fairly well.
The overall change in public assessments of the military’s approach to the Islamic State is largely attributable to a sharp shift in GOP views over the past year. Today, two-thirds (67%) of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the campaign is going well. In surveys conducted throughout the first years of the military campaign against ISIS (and during Barack Obama’s administration), no more than three-in-ten Republicans said this.
