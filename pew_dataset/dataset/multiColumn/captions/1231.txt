There are again some differences in attitudes by demographic characteristics and political affiliation. For example, roughly four-in-ten black adults (43%) and about a third of Hispanic adults (31%) say it is very or somewhat important that the professional athletes they support share their political views, but just 15% of white adults hold this view. In contrast, a majority of white Americans (58%) say itâ€™s not too or not at all important that professional athletes share their political views.
