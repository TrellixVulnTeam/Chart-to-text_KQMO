Through much of this election cycle – especially in recent months – interest in campaign news has been comparable to interest in the 2008 race. Four years ago, the percentage following presidential election news very closely dipped following the early primary fights between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton but then ramped up sharply at the end of the summer as the parties met to nominate their candidates. Interest continued to rise until Election Day.
Similarly in 2004, interest in campaign news increased following the conventions. That year, the Democratic convention was held at the end of July and the GOP convention spanned the end of August and the start of September. In July, 29% said they were following news about the presidential campaign very closely. That increased to 40% in September, following the conventions that nominated George W. Bush and John Kerry.
