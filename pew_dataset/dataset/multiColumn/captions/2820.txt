About seven-in-ten Republicans (72%) say they agree with the Republican Party almost always (22%) or more than half of the time (51%) on issues; another 21% agree with the party “about half of the time,” while just 7% agree “less than half of the time” or “almost never.”
Both Republicans and Democrats have largely positive views of members of the military and police officers, though in both cases Republicans’ ratings of the groups are warmer than Democratic ratings.
Fully 93% of Republicans have a warm rating of people in the military, including 86% who give a very warm rating (76 or higher on the 0-100 scale). Though Democrats are less intensely positive than Republicans about members the military, 82% give a warm rating – including 69% who view service members very warmly.
The partisan divide is more pronounced in views of police officers. Overall, 64% of the public views police officers warmly, 16% give them a neutral rating, while 18% view them coldly. While 86% of Republicans give officers warm ratings – and about three-quarters (74%) view them very warmly – a smaller majority of Democrats (57%) view officers warmly, and just 33% give them very warm ratings. Independents’ ratings are similar to Democrats (65% warm, 43% very warm). Still, only about two-in-ten Democrats (19%) or independents (16%) view officers coldly.
