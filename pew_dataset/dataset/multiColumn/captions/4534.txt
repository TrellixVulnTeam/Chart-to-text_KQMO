However, the harshest assessments of Obama are found in an increasingly anti-American Russia. Only 11% of Russians express confidence in the U.S. president. Obama has never been very popular in Russia, but 29% did voice confidence in him two years ago, before the outbreak of violence in Ukraine. Nine-in-ten Russians disapprove of how Obama is handling the Ukraine crisis. The percentage of Russians with a favorable view of the U.S. has also declined sharply over the past two years, dropping from 51% in 2013 to 15% this spring.
