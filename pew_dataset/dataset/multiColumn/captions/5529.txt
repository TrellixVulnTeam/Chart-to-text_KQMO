President Obama visits Mexico on Wednesday for what has become known as the “Three Amigos Summit” with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. It comes at a time when the U.S. public has a positive view of Canada, but more lukewarm feelings toward Mexico.
Only 39% of Americans expressed a favorable view of Mexico in a Pew Research Center survey conducted last October-November. This represents a substantial rise in unfavorable opinions of America’s southern neighbor since 2007, when the balance of opinion toward Mexico was positive (47% favorable, 37% unfavorable). In addition, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to view Mexico favorably, with 44% of Democrats holding a positive impression while just three-in-ten Republicans (30%) say the same.
