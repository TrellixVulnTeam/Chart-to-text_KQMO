In general, online dating services use data to improve customer experience, namely to present users with better matches. To get a sense of how people rate their knowledge of the digital matchmaking process, the Center asked online dating users how well they feel they understand why online dating services present certain people as potential matches. The majority of online dating users (58%) report they understand the process either very or somewhat well.
Among online daters who characterize their previous experiences with dating sites and apps as very or somewhat positive, nearly seven-in-ten (69%) report understanding the process very or somewhat well, compared with 44% of those who have had very or somewhat negative experiences with online dating. A similar pattern exists for those who have met their current partners through online dating.
