The Pew poll, conducted April-May 2007, shows the extent to which Lebanon’s three major religious communities differ in their views of these two rival powers. Overwhelmingly, Christians see America in a positive light — 82% have a favorable opinion of the United States. Shia, on the other hand, are decidedly negative — only 7% have a favorable view. Sunnis occupy a middle ground, with roughly half (52%) holding a positive view. This is a considerably higher level of support than the United States receives among Lebanon’s largely Sunni neighbors — for instance, only 21% of Egyptians, 20% of Jordanians, 13% of Palestinians, and 9% of Turks hold a positive opinion of the U.S. In fact, the U.S. receives more favorable marks among Lebanese Sunnis than among some of America’s closest European allies, including Britain (51% favorable), France (39%), and Germany (30%).
Opinions of Iran follow a markedly different pattern. Positive views of the Islamic Republic are rare in both the Christian (14% favorable) and Sunni communities (8%). However, Lebanese Shia overwhelmingly have favorable attitudes toward Iran (86%), which of course is a largely Shia country. The same pattern characterizes opinions of Iran’s controversial president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: 75% of Shia have confidence in Ahmadinejad to do the right thing in world affairs, compared with only 9% of Christians and 5% of Sunnis who share that view. And while roughly three-in-four (76%) Shia approve of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, only 4% of Christians and 7% of Sunnis support the idea of a nuclear-armed Iran.
