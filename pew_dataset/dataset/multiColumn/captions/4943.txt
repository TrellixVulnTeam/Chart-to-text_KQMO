On average, people in emerging and developing economies have low political efficacy. Majorities or pluralities in 31 of the 33 countries surveyed say that most government officials do not care what people like them think. This view is especially common in Latin America, where a median of 77% say their political opinions matter little to politicians, compared with just 13% who say government officials do care and 5% who volunteer that neither or both are true. The belief that government officials ignore average citizens is particularly strong among Brazilians, 90% of whom say their government does not care.
About two-thirds in the Middle East (67%) and Africa (65%) express doubts that political leaders pay attention to their opinions. In fact, South Africa is the only country surveyed in these two regions where fewer than half (43%) hold this view. Across these regions, roughly two-in-ten believe politicians care (19% in the Middle East, 20% in Africa).
Political efficacy in Eastern Europe is similarly low. More than seven-in-ten in the three nations surveyed believe that government officials care little about the views of people like them. Ukrainians have the lowest political efficacy with 83% saying that officials care little about their opinions.
Political efficacy is highest in Asia, but a median of 55% across the region still say that government officials do not care about what they think. Roughly a quarter (23%) believes politicians pay attention to their opinions, while 10% say neither. Filipinos far and away have the highest political efficacy of those surveyed. The Philippines is the only country in which at least half (52%) say government officials care about what people like them think. Still, more than a third (36%) believe politicians care little about their concerns, while 8% agree with neither or both.
