While majorities of nearly all Republican groups back substantially expanding the wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, those ages 18 to 49 are less likely to support this policy than those 50 and older (60% compared with 83%). And support for an expended border wall is significantly higher among conservative Republicans (81%) than among moderates and liberals (55%).
Opinions about expanding the U.S.-Mexico border wall vary more widely across groups. For instance, 45% of whites favor expanding the wall, about twice the shares of blacks (22%) and Hispanics (20%).
