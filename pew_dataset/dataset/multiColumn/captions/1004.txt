As the number of asylum seekers from Central America and elsewhere has surged at the U.S.-Mexico border, Hispanics are broadly critical of the federal government’s response. Around six-in-ten Hispanics (63%) say the U.S. government has done a somewhat (36%) or very bad (26%) job at dealing with the increased number of people seeking asylum at the nation’s southern border. But views on this question break sharply along party lines. Three-in-four Democrats (75%) say the U.S. government has done a bad job, while about half of Republicans (55%) say the government has done a good job.
