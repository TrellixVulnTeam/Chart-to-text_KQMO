Politically, people also tend to see a trade-off between the two superpowers. About half of adults in Taiwan (49%) would support closer political ties to the U.S. but would not say the same of mainland China. Adults who prefer political ties to the U.S. over ties to the mainland are more likely to be ages 18 to 29, support the currently ruling DPP or identify solely as Taiwanese. No more than about one-in-ten reject closer political ties to both countries or support closer political ties with China but not the U.S.
