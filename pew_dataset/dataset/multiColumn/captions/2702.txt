Facebook claims the largest share of social media news consumers, and its news users are much more likely to rely solely on that site for news. Just under half (45%) of U.S. adults use Facebook for news. Half of Facebookâ€™s news users get news from that social media site alone, with just one-in-five relying on three or more sites for news.
