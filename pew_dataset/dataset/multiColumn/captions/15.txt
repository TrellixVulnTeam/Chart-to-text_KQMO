An estimated 940,000 Hispanics of Honduran origin lived in the United States in 2017, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Hondurans in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Honduran origin; this includes immigrants from Honduras and those who trace their family ancestry to Honduras.
Hondurans are the eighth-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States, accounting for 2% of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017. Since 2000, the Honduran-origin population has increased 296%, growing from 237,000 to 940,000 over the period. At the same time, the Honduran foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew by 215%, from 184,000 in 2000 to 579,000 in 2017. By comparison, Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, constituted 36.6 million, or 62%, of the Hispanic population in 2017.
