About half (53%) of Latinos ages 18 to 29 and a similar share of those ages 30 to 49 (50%) say they or someone in their household has lost a job or had their pay cut because of the coronavirus outbreak. In contrast, 39% of Latinos 50 and older say the same.
Meanwhile, about half of Latinos without a college degree – 50% with a high school degree or less and 52% with some college experience – say they or someone in their household has lost a job or had their pay cut. By comparison, a smaller share of Latinos with a college degree (37%) say they have experienced one of these events. Even so, across all education levels, higher shares of Latinos than of the general public say someone in their household has lost their job, taken a pay cut or both because of the COVID-19 outbreak.
