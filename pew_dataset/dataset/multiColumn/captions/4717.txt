More than any other state, Hawaii stands out when it comes to its racial and ethnic diversity. The Rainbow State has never had a white majority. In fact, non-Hispanic whites, the largest group in most states, account for only 23% of the population, according to 2013 census figures.
But the real population story is about Native Hawaiians, those who are descended from the original people of Hawaii and who today make up 6% of the islands’ population, or 21% if you include those who are part-Hawaiian. A new demographic analysis, using an innovative technique, estimates that there were 683,000 Native Hawaiians on the island in 1778, when British explorer Capt. James Cook arrived. That’s on the higher range of the highly disputed historical estimates, which have ranged from as low as 200,000 to as high as 1 million. (Today, Hawaii’s total population stands at 1.4 million.)
