This chart subdivides the entry cohorts of Mexican migrants by legal status (and presents the data in bars that represent the average annual flows).
The cohorts who have entered from Mexico since 1990 (i.e., in the U.S. for 14 years or less) are principally unauthorized. This trend translates into an average of about 400,000-485,000 annual unauthorized entrants from Mexico. Of those cohorts in the country more than 14 years, most are legal residents. For those entering before 1985, virtually all are legal. (In fact, the unauthorized component shown for the pre-1985 entrants may be largely estimation and sampling error.)
