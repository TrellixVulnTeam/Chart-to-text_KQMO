Male gun owners are more likely than female gun owners to say there is a gun that is both loaded and easily accessible to them all of the time when theyâ€™re at home. Some 43% of men who own guns say this is the case, compared with 29% of women gun owners. However, among those who own handguns, equal shares of men and women (26% each) say they carry their gun outside their home all or most of the time.
