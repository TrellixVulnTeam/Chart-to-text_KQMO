About three-quarters of Muslim Americans (74%) say President Donald Trump is unfriendly toward them, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. And they are no fans of Trump’s: Just 19% say they approve of the job Trump is doing as president, and among Muslims who reported voting last November, only 8% say they cast their ballots for him.
Most Muslim Americans (64%) also say they are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the U.S. – a sharp rise since the Center’s last comprehensive survey of U.S. Muslims in 2011, when just 38% took this position and 56% said they were satisfied with the country’s direction. In stark contrast with their current feelings about Trump, most Muslims in 2011 approved of the job Barack Obama was doing as president (76%) and very few said he was unfriendly toward their group (4%).
