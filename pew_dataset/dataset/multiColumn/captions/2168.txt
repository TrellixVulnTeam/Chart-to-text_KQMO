Along with confidence in their leader, a majority of Russians are also satisfied with the direction of their country. In 2018, 57% of Russians say they are satisfied with the way things are going in Russia today, compared with 40% who are dissatisfied. Russians have been satisfied with the current state of the nation since 2014, but before then, stretching back to 2002, Russian attitudes were generally more negative about the direction of the country. Those who have confidence in Putin are about three times as likely to say the country is going in the right direction (63% satisfied) compared with those who lack confidence (20%).
