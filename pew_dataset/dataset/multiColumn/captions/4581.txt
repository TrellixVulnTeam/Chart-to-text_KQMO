Under projections published in 2007, the state’s Hispanic population was expected to reach 31 million in 2050, or 52.1% of all Californians. But according to updated projections released late last year, Hispanics are now expected to number 23.7 million in 2050, or 47.6% of all Californians. That pushes the prospect of a Hispanic demographic majority further into the future – perhaps to sometime after 2060.
California’s total population projections have also been reduced. In 2007, the state’s population had been projected to reach 59.5 million in 2050. But now, the latest projections say the population will reach 49.8 million in 2050, about 10 million less than the earlier projection.
