About three-quarters of Canadians (76%) have confidence in President Obama to handle international affairs, versus only 23% who express little or no confidence. This majority is less overwhelming than in 2009, however, when nearly nine-in-ten Canadians (88%) had confidence in him. In the current survey, women (82%) are more likely than men (69%) to express confidence in Obama.
