A study from 2014 also revealed that conservatives and liberals have different experiences seeing posts about politics on Facebook. About half of Facebook users who express consistently conservative views across a range of political values questions (47%) see posts on the site that align with their views all or most of the time, compared with only about a third (32%) of those who express consistently liberal views.
However, a larger share of these consistently liberal Facebook users than of consistent conservatives have de-friended, hidden or blocked someone because of something that friend posted about politics (44%, vs. 31%). Both groups, however, are more likely than those with more mixed political views to report seeing like-minded views and blocking others at much higher rates. Overall, most Facebook users see a mix of views on the platform: Only about a quarter of Facebook users (23%) see views that align with their own all or most of the time.
