While supporters of each candidate are more likely to turn to their preferred candidate’s social media, the data also reveal some political cross-pollination. Among registered voters, one-in-ten Trump supporters go to Clinton’s social media posts, which is similar to the 13% of Clinton supporters who turn to Trump’s. What’s more, the rate at which these registered voters turn to the opposing candidate’s social media feed is about on par with the rate at which they turn to their preferred candidate’s website or emails: About one-in-ten Clinton supporters (11%) turn to her website and the same portion turn to her emails, where as 10% of Trump’s supporters turn to his website and 6% to his emails. Very few turn to the websites and emails of the opposing candidate.
