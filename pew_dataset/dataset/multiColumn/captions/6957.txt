Italian opinion about the influence immigrants were having on their country was also among the most negative of the 47 nations surveyed in 2007.
Nearly three-quarters of Italians (73%) said immigrants had a bad impact on their country; only in South Africa was this view as widespread â€” 75% of South Africans said immigrants had a negative influence on their country.
Italy was the only country of the Western European nations surveyed where a majority viewed the impact of immigrants negatively. Publics in Britain, France, Germany and Spain were divided, while the Swedes had an overwhelmingly positive view of the influence immigrants had on their country.
