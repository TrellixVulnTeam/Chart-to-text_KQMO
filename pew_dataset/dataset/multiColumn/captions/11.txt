An estimated 679,000 Hispanics of Peruvian origin lived in the United States in 2017, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Peruvians in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Peruvian origin; this includes immigrants from Peru and those who trace their family ancestry to Peru.
Peruvians are the 11th-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States, accounting for about 1% of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017. Since 2000, the Peruvian-origin population has increased 174%, growing from 248,000 to 679,000 over the period. At the same time, the Peruvian foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew by 120%, from 193,000 in 2000 to 423,000 in 2017. By comparison, Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, constituted 36.6 million, or 62%, of the Hispanic population in 2017.
