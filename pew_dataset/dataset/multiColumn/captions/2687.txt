The new survey finds that public concerns about the nation’s budget deficit are lower today than during Barack Obama’s presidency. About half of Americans (54%) view the deficit as a “very serious” problem for the country, while 35% regard it as a “somewhat serious” problem. Very few, just 10%, think it is not much of a problem.
