Blacks are also divided about the impact racial discrimination has on black progress today, but the age groups align slightly differently on this measure. Survey respondents in the pre-Ferguson Pew Research poll were asked which of the following statements came closer to their own views: Racial discrimination is the main reason why many black people can’t get ahead these days, or blacks who can’t get ahead in this country are mostly responsible for their own condition. Overall, blacks split fairly evenly on this question, with 43% choosing the first statement and 48% choosing the second one.
