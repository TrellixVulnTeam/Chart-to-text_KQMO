Digital ad spending went up 20% last year, and mobile advertising now tops desktop, but journalism organizations have not been the primary beneficiaries. There was explosive growth in mobile advertising, which increased by 65%, reaching $32 billion – higher than desktop advertising for the first year ever. Almost two-thirds of this $60 billion in digital advertising spending (65%) went to just five technology companies: Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Microsoft and Twitter. Despite this, legacy news gets relatively little boost from this digital boom. Only 5% of local television stations’ advertising revenue is from digital, according to data from BIA/Kelsey. And while 25% of publicly held newspapers’ ad revenue is from digital, they actually saw overall digital ad revenue fall by 2% in 2015.
