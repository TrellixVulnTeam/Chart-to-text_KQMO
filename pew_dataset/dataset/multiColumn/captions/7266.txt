Public interest in news about the Olympics rivaled that of the presidential campaign last week. Roughly one-in-four Americans followed each of these two stories very closely and approximately one-in-five said that either the campaign (21%) or the Olympics (20%) was the story they followed most closely last week. In terms of news coverage, campaign reporting exceeded Olympic coverage by more than double (24% vs. 11%), but there were significant differences between media sectors. The campaign was the biggest story in three-out-of-five sectors (cable TV, network television and on radio), while the Olympics was the number one story in newspaper and online coverage.
