An estimated 210,000 Hispanics of Panamanian origin lived in the United States in 2017, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Panamanians in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Panamanian origin; this includes immigrants from Panama and those who trace their family ancestry to Panama.
Panamanians are the 15th-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States, accounting for less than 1% of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017. Since 2000, the Panamanian-origin population has increased 108%, growing from 101,000 to 210,000 over the period. At the same time, the Panamanian foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew by 39%, from 61,000 in 2000 to 85,000 in 2017. By comparison, Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, constituted 36.6 million, or 62%, of the Hispanic population in 2017.
