Many Americans say Russia’s power and influence are a major threat to the U.S. While Russians see greater global influence for their country, around half of Americans (52%) said in an October 2017 survey that Russia’s “power and influence” constitute a major threat to U.S. well-being, compared with 38% who said Russian power is a minor threat and 9% who said it is not a threat. These views varied substantially by party. Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents were far more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to say Russia’s power and influence are a major threat (63% vs. 38%). For many years, Republicans and Democrats generally shared views on Russia’s threat level, but partisan differences increased sharply after the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
