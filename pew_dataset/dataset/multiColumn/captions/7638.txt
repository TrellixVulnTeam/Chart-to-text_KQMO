As the cell-only population has grown, telephone surveys by Pew and other organizations that rely on landline samples have experienced a sharp decline in the percentage of younger respondents interviewed in their samples. In Pew Research Center surveys over the past five years, the average percentage of those ages 18-34 in unweighted samples declined from 31% in 2000 to 20% through March 2006 (the population parameter was essentially unchanged through this period). This decline is consistent with the fact that the cell-only population is heavily tilted toward young people.
