A near-consensus of Democratic voters say climate change is a problem for the U.S. Among Democratic registered voters (including those who lean to the Democratic Party) who support any of the five leading candidates for their party’s nomination as of mid-January, more than nine-in-ten say climate change is at least a moderately big problem for the country today – including three-quarters or more who say it’s a very big problem. There are some differences in voters’ degree of concern: Joe Biden and Michael Bloomberg supporters are slightly less likely to describe climate change as a very big problem, compared with supporters of other candidates.
As with other issues related to climate and the environment, the partisan divide on this question is large: Just 41% of Republican registered voters (including those who lean to the GOP) say climate change is a moderately or very big problem for the country.
