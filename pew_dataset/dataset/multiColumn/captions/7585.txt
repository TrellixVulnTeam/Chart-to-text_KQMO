The percent of Democratic voters who think of themselves as “liberals” has been slowly rising in recent years, while the number of conservative Democrats has declined. In polling conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press from January to September of 2006, 32% of Democrats describe themselves as ideologically liberal, while 23% think of themselves as conservative. This reflects a starkly different balance of opinion from four years ago, when there were as many conservative Democrats as liberals (27% and 26%, respectively).
