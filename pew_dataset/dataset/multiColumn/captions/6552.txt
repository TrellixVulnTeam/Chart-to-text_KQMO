Americans last week followed news about the struggling economy and the resignation of Rep. Anthony Weiner from Congress more closely than other top stories, while the early stages of the 2012 presidential election led news coverage for this first time this year.
Two-in-ten (20%) say they followed reports about the condition of the U.S. economy most closely, while 16% followed developments in the Weiner scandal that closely, according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey, conducted June 16-19 among 1,003 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press.
About one-in-ten (11%) say news about the 2012 presidential election was their top story. Coverage of the potential candidates, driven in large part by the Republican debate in New Hampshire, accounted for 15% of coverage, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). Coverage of the economy made up 12% of the newshole, while Weiner’s resignation accounted for 9%. One week earlier, the Weiner story, including his acknowledgment that he had sent sexually-suggestive photos and messages online to at least six women, was the top story with 17% of coverage.
