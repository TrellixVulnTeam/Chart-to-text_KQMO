A large majority of Republicans (71%) said that government aid to the poor does more harm than good, but there are divisions within the party based on income, according to the February survey. Eight-in-ten Republicans with annual incomes of $75,000 or more say government aid to the poor does more harm than good, as do 71% of those with incomes of $30,000-$74,999.
But lower-income Republicans are less likely to agree. Among those with incomes of less than $30,000, 48% say it does more good than harm while 45% say it does more harm than good.
