An estimated 810,000 Hispanics with origins from Spain – that is, those who are immigrants from or who trace their family ancestry to Spain – resided in the United States in 2017, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Spaniards in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics with origins from Spain.
Spaniards are the ninth-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States, accounting for 1% of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017. Since 2010, the population with origins from Spain has increased 15%, growing from 707,000 to 810,000 over the period. At the same time, the foreign-born population with origins from Spain living in the U.S. grew by 41%, from 91,000 in 2010 to 129,000 in 2017. By comparison, Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, constituted 36.6 million, or 62%, of the Hispanic population in 2017.
