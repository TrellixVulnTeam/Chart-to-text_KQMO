By increasingly wide margins, Americans say they want to see U.S. troops return from Iraq as soon as possible, as opposed to staying until the situation there has stabilized. Currently, 56% favor bringing the troops home as soon as possible – the most ever in a Pew survey – while 39% say troops should stay until things are stable. The percent saying the troops should come home soon is up two points since April, and 11 points since June 2006.
