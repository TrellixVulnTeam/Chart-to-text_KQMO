Africans clearly want a good relationship with the U.S., although positive relations with Beijing are also a priority. When asked whether it is more important for their country to have strong ties with the U.S. or China, the balance of opinion leans toward the U.S. in Uganda, Senegal, and Ghana, while Kenyans and South Africans are more divided. In Nigeria, 37% say a strong relationship with China is more important, compared with just 17% who say this about the U.S. (the question was not asked in Egypt or Tunisia).
