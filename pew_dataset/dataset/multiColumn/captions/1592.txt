The nationâ€™s voting population in 2018 was the most racially and ethnically diverse ever for a midterm election. Blacks, Hispanics and Asians accounted for a record 25.0% of voters, up from 21.7% in 2014. Whites continue to make up the vast majority of voters (72.8%) and their overall numbers continue to grow. However, as a share of U.S. voters, the 3.5 percentage point drop among white voters since 2014 is one of the largest declines between midterms in decades.
