Across 17 countries, a median of 66% say their country’s current economic relations with China are good. Similarly high numbers (a median of 64%) also rate current U.S. economic relations with their countries favorably.

A median of 48% say China is having a positive impact on economic conditions in their country, compared with 42% who say the same of the U.S.
