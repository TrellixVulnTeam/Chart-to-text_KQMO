Overall, nearly nine-in-ten Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (87%) and about seven-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners (71%) said they had a fair amount or great deal of confidence in police officers to act in the best interests of the public. But there were wide divisions between black and white Democrats in their confidence in police officers. While 78% of white Democrats said they had at least a fair amount of confidence in officers to act in the publicâ€™s best interests, just 54% of black Democrats said the same.
