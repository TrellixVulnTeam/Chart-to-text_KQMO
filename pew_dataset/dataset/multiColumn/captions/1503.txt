Among people with partners, many more bisexual adults are married or in a relationship with someone of the opposite sex than are with someone of the same sex â€“ 88% say this. This is likely due at least in part to the fact that LGB adults make up a small share of the overall adult population, so the pool of potential same-sex partners is much smaller than the pool of opposite-sex partners. Meanwhile, all the respondents in the survey who identified as straight were in opposite-sex relationships, and nearly all (94%) of those who identified as gay or lesbian were in same-sex relationships.
