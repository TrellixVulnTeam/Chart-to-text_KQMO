About two-thirds of Americans say the country’s openness to people from around the world is “essential to who we are as a nation.” Just 29% say that if America is too open to people from other countries, “we risk losing our identity as a nation,” according to a summer 2017 survey. Eight-in-ten Millennials say America’s openness is key to the nation’s identity, compared with 68% of Gen Xers, 61% of Boomers and 54% of Silents. Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to say that America’s openness is essential to the country’s identity (84% vs. 47%).
