This stands in contrast with Latin America and Africa, where about six-in-ten people (a median of 61% and 59%, respectively) express serious concerns about the threat posed by global climate change. It ranks as the greatest threat in nearly every country in these two regions. Asians are also relatively concerned about climate change. With a median of 41% voicing serious concern, the issue captures the top spot in half of the Asia-Pacific countries surveyed.
