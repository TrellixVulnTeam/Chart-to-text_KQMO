More than one-fourth of Hispanic adults in the United States lack a usual health care provider, and a similar proportion report obtaining no health care information from medical personnel in the past year. At the same time, more than eight in 10 report receiving health information from alternative sources, such as television and radio, according to a Pew Hispanic Center (PHC) survey of Latino adults, conducted in conjunction with the RobertWood Johnson Foundation (RWJF).
