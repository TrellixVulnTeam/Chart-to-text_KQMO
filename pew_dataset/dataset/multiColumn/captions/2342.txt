About three-quarters of conservative Republicans (77%) continue to say the Supreme Court should base its rulings on the Constitution’s original meaning rather than its meaning in current times (21%). But moderate and liberal Republicans are more divided: 50% favor an interpretation based on the Constitution’s original meaning, compared with 46% who say the court should base its rulings on a current interpretation.
Ideological differences are less pronounced among Democrats. Liberal Democrats (88%) overwhelmingly say the Supreme Court should base its rulings on the Constitution’s meaning in current times, as do a majority (70%) of conservative and moderate Democrats.
Views on constitutional interpretation also vary by age, even within both partisan coalitions. Americans 50 and older are divided, with 47% saying the Supreme Court should base its rulings on what the Constitution currently means and 49% saying they favor an interpretation based on the document’s original meaning. But among Americans younger than 50, 64% say the high court should base rulings on the Constitution’s current meaning, compared with 33% who say decisions should be based on the original meaning.
