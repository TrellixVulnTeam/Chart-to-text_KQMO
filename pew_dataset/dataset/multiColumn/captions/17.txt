An estimated 738,000 Hispanics of Ecuadorian origin lived in the United States in 2017, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Ecuadorians in this statistical profile are people who self-identified as Hispanics of Ecuadorian origin; this includes immigrants from Ecuador and those who trace their family ancestry to Ecuador.
Ecuadorians are the 10th-largest population of Hispanic origin living in the United States, accounting for 1% of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2017. Since 2000, the Ecuadorian-origin population has increased 174%, growing from 270,000 to 738,000 over the period. At the same time, the Ecuadorian foreign-born population living in the U.S. grew by 109%, from 205,000 in 2000 to 427,000 in 2017. By comparison, Mexicans, the nation’s largest Hispanic origin group, constituted 36.6 million, or 62%, of the Hispanic population in 2017.
