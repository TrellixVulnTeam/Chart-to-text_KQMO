In January 2005, Bush earned a lofty 89% approval from members of his own party, but that has declined to 73% in the current survey. Among independents, the number approving of Bush’s job performance has fallen from 47% in January 2005 to 26% today; and Bush’s support among Democrats, already quite low, has fallen by about half since the start of his second term (from 17% to 9%).
