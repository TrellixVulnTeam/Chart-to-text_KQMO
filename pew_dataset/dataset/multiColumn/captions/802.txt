But there are wide partisan gaps in these views – with Republicans much more confident than Democrats in the fairness and accessibility of the election. While three-quarters of Republicans and Republican leaners say they are at least somewhat confident the upcoming election will be conducted fairly and accurately, just 46% of Democrats and Democratic leaners say the same (with a majority saying they are not too or not at all confident in this). The partisan gap is even wider when it comes to ballot access. Nearly nine-in-ten Republicans express at least some confidence that “all citizens who want to vote in the election will be able to” – including 41% who say they are very confident about this. By comparison, just 43% of Democrats say they are at least somewhat confident all citizens who want to vote will be able to do so, while 56% say they are not too or not at all confident about this.
Among Democrats, confidence that the presidential election in November will be conducted fairly and accurately varies by ideology as well as by race and ethnicity. About half of conservative and moderate Democrats (52%) say they are either somewhat or very confident that the election will be conducted fairly and accurately, compared with 37% of liberal Democrats who say this. Similarly, while about half of conservative and moderate Democrats (53%) are somewhat or very confident that all citizens who want to vote will be able to do, 31% of liberals hold this view.
