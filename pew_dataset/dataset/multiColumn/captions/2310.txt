While the parties’ most prominent economic policy goals may differ, majorities of both Five Star (82%) and League supporters (74%) agree that it is the government’s responsibility to ensure a decent standard of living for all. Moreover, about two-thirds of both parties’ supporters strongly feel the government should guarantee everyone a decent standard of living, which is substantially higher than the 51% who say this among the rest of the Italian public.
