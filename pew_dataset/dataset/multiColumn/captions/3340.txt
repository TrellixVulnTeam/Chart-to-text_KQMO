Black and white police officers have strikingly different views on a number of important issues related to their jobs, including recent fatal encounters between law enforcement and black citizens and the protests that those encounters have sparked, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. On some subjects, racial differences among the police are considerably more pronounced than they are among the public as a whole.
Black officers are about twice as likely as white officers (57% vs. 27%) to say that recent deaths of blacks during encounters with police are signs of a broader problem and not isolated incidents, according to the survey of nearly 8,000 sworn officers working in departments of 100 officers or more, which was conducted on behalf of the Center by the National Police Research Platform. The general public is also divided by race on this question, but majorities of both blacks (79%) and whites (54%) say recent fatal encounters are part of a broader problem and arenâ€™t isolated incidents.
Views of the protests that have followed these encounters also differ sharply by race, especially among police. About seven-in-ten black officers (69%) say that the protests are motivated some or a great deal by a genuine desire to hold police accountable for their actions, compared with just 27% of white officers who hold this view. Among the general public, 79% of blacks and 63% of whites say the protests are motivated some or a great deal by a genuine desire to hold police accountable.
