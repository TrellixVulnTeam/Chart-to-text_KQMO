Between its inception in January 2017 and its final day on Jan. 3, the GOP-led 115th Congress enacted 442 public laws, the most since the 110th Congress (2007-09). Of those laws, 69% were substantive (as judged by our deliberately generous criteria) – not much different from the 71% substantive share achieved by the 114th Congress, in which the Republican-controlled House and Senate faced off against Democratic President Barack Obama. (The 114th Congress passed 329 laws in total.)
In our regular assessments of Congress’ legislative productivity, we’ve cast a wide net regarding what makes a law “substantive.” Basically, anything that makes a change in federal law (however tiny) or authorizes the spending of taxpayer dollars (however few) makes the cut. Besides the measures referred to above on building-renamings, we count laws as “ceremonial” if they award medals, designate special days, authorize commemorative coins or otherwise memorialize historic events. (We exclude entirely “private laws,” which typically exempt a single person from a single provision of general law.)
Looking back over the past 30 years, the 101st Congress (1989-1991) passed the most laws in total (650) and had the lowest percentage of substantive laws (63%). That’s because it, like many Congresses before, passed dozens of laws designating special observances – National Tap Dance Day, National Quarter Horse Week, National Library Card Sign-Up Month and the like. That practice diminished over the next few years and was largely ended by the 104th Congress in the mid-1990s.
Since then, only one Congress has chalked up a lower share of substantive legislation than the just-ended 115th. That was the 110th, held after Democrats retook the House and Senate in the 2006 midterms during Republican George W. Bush’s final two years as president. Only 64% of the laws enacted by that Congress were substantive, by our reckoning.
