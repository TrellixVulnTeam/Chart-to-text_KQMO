And, two weeks after Republican Scott Brown won the Massachusetts special election for Edward M. Kennedy’s Senate seat, 60% of Americans say they do not think health care legislation will pass this year. That’s down slightly from 67% just after the special election, but still a stark reversal from immediately before the Jan. 19 vote. At that point, 57% said they thought legislation would pass this year, while 33% said they thought it would not. About one-in-ten (11%) now say they do not know, up from 5% one week earlier.
