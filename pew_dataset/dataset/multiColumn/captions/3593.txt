Of the more than 70,000 refugees who have been admitted to the U.S. so far in fiscal year 2016, the largest numbers have come from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burma (Myanmar) and Syria. (Refugees in the U.S. are defined differently and a different process is used in accepting refugees than in the EU.)
