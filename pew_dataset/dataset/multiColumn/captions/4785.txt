Just over half (54%) of U.S. adults say they were in favor of greater access to experimental drugs before clinical trials have shown drugs to be safe or effective, while 43% oppose wider access. Views, however, vary greatly by household income and race.
Nearly three-quarters (72%) of adults who live in households earning $75,000 or more a year favor allowing more people access to experimental drugs before clinical trials are finished, while 26% are against wider availability of such drugs. In comparison, adults whose annual family income is less than $30,000 are more divided on the issue: 46% are in favor of wider access while 51% are in opposition.
