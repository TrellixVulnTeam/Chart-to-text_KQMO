The survey found that almost three in four Latino adults are either themselves without health insurance or personally know someone who does not have insurance coverage. In addition, a substantial minority of Latinos reports health care challenges, such as problems paying medical bills, delays seeking care because of costs, and not getting needed health care services. Furthermore, some Latinos report having problems communicating with health care providers due to language barriers, or having difficulty getting care due to their race and ethnic background.
Over one-third of Latino adults report lacking health insurance. In addition, almost six in ten (59%) of those who do have health insurance say that they personally know someone who does not (38% of all Latinos). Together, 73% of Latinos either lack health insurance coverage themselves, or know someone who is uninsured (see Chart 1).
