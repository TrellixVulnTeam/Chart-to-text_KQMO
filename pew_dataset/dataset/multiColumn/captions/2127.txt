In a survey conducted in fall 2016, about half of U.S. adults (49%) said the bigger concern about the government’s anti-terrorism policies is that they have not gone far enough to adequately protect the country, while a third said the bigger concern is that they have gone too far in restricting the average person’s civil liberties.
Since 2004, Americans have generally expressed more concern about the government’s policies not going far enough than about civil liberties. Yet the reverse was true in 2013, shortly after leaks of classified information about government surveillance by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. In two surveys that year, Americans were more likely to say the government was going too far in restricting civil liberties than not going far enough to protect the nation.
Republicans have generally been more likely than Democrats to say the bigger concern about the government’s anti-terrorism policies is that they don’t go far enough to protect the country. This has been especially true in recent years: In the fall 2016 survey, around two-thirds of Republicans (68%) said the government’s policies don’t go far enough – tied for the highest share holding that view since 2004. Fewer Democrats said the same (46%).
