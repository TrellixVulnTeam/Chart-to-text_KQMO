Overall, half of Americans say that society does not place enough importance on working and having a job; 19% say that society places too much importance on work, while the remaining 31% think that balance is just about right. However, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are about twice as likely as Democrats and Democratic leaners to say that society doesn’t place enough importance on working (69% vs. 35%).
There is also a substantial age gap in how Americans view work. Two-thirds (67%) of U.S. adults ages 65 and older – and 55% of those ages 50 to 64 – think that society does not place enough importance on working. That share falls to just 36% among those 18 to 29.
