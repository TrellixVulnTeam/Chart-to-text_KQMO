Obama continued to overshadow John McCain, not only in terms of news coverage but also in public visibility. The Illinois senator was featured prominently in 82% of all campaign stories, more than double the number of stories mentioning McCain (40%).
Consistent with the balance of coverage, the public reported hearing far more about Obama than about McCain in recent weeks. Three-quarters of Americans said that Obama was the candidate they had heard most about in the news. This compares with only 10% who named McCain. Obama was far more visible than McCain among Republicans (69% vs. 17%) as well as Democrats (81% vs. 8%).
