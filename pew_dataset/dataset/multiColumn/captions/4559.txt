Despite the negative economic mood in Russia, President Putin still receives overwhelming support from the public. On foreign relations, eight-in-ten or more approve of his dealings with China, the U.S., Ukraine and the European Union. In the domestic realm, overwhelming majorities support his energy policy (73%) and his handling of the economy (70%). His lowest rating is for his handling of corruption, but even here, 62% of the Russian public supports him.
