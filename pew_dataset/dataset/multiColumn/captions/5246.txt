Regarding the job situation, three-in-ten Democrats (30%) are hearing mostly good news about jobs, nearly double the share from February (16%). By contrast, Republicansâ€™ views are little changed since then and only 13% say they are hearing mostly good news. Among independents, the percentage hearing mostly bad news about jobs has declined from 46% in February to 31% in the current survey.
