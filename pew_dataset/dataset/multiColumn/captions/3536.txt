Although nearly half of married Americans say shared religious beliefs are very important to a successful marriage, considerably fewer (27%) say the religion of their spouse was a very important factor in their choosing who to marry. Another 21% say their spouse’s religion was “somewhat” important in their decision to wed.
Again, those who are married to someone in the same religious group are more likely than religiously intermarried people to say their spouse’s faith tradition was an important factor in their decision marry them. A majority of those married to someone of the same faith say this was a very (36%) or somewhat (26%) important element in their choice, while most of those who are married to someone with a different religious identity (including people in marriages between a religiously affiliated person and a religious “none”) say their spouse’s religion was not an important factor.
