The overall partisan gap between Republicans and Democrats in views of Kavanaugh’s nomination is as large as it has been for any nominee in recent years.
Republicans and Republican leaners (73%) are 57-percentage points more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners (16%) to say they think the Senate should confirm Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. This is about the same as the partisan gap in views of Neil Gorsuch in February 2017 (55 points), but larger than for previous appointments made by George W. Bush and Obama.
For example, in June 2009 there was a 36-point gap between the shares of Republicans (30%) and Democrats (66%) who supported the confirmation of Obama’s nominee Sonya Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. And in September 2005, the partisan gap in views of Bush’s nominee John Roberts was about half of what it is today for Kavanaugh (30 points vs. 57 points).
