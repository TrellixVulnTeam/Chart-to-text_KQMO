Retail is one of the more seasonably variable industries when it comes to payroll jobs (though not the only one — construction, leisure and hospitality, and education, among others, also exhibit strong seasonal employment patterns). Retail payrolls surge in November and December as stores hire for holiday shopping — typically jumping 3% to 4% between October and December. Last year, for example, retailers added 626,200 jobs in November and December, representing a 4.1% gain. (These are the sorts of predictable moves that are smoothed out in the seasonally adjusted jobs numbers, which generally are the ones that get the most attention.)
