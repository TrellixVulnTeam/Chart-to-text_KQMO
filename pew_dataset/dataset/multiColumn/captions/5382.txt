Bachelorâ€™s degree recipients from private schools graduated with higher average debt than those with four-year degrees from public schools. A typical private non-profit college graduate in 2011-2012 who borrowed to complete their education graduated with $32,308 in loans (those graduating from private for-profit colleges owed even more, at about $40,038), compared with $25,640 among public university graduates the same year.
