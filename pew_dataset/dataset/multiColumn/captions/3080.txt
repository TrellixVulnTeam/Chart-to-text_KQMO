The increased prevalence of living with mom and/or dad is more prominent among less-educated young adults. In 2016, only 10% of Millennials who had completed at least a bachelor’s degree lived at home, compared with 7% of college-educated Gen Xers who lived at home in 2000. By contrast, 20% of young adults with no more than a high school diploma lived in their parents’ home in 2016, up from 12% of Gen Xers in 2000.
