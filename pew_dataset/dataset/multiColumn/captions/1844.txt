There was a time when Catholics in both parties were largely united in their admiration for Pope Francis. But in recent months, even these views have become more polarized along party lines, with Catholic Democrats and Democratic leaners viewing Francis more favorably than Catholic Republicans and GOP leaners. Among Catholics, Republicans are now much more likely than Democrats to say the pope is “too liberal” (55% vs. 19%) and “naïve” (32% vs. 18%). While most Catholic Democrats (67%) say Francis is doing an excellent or good job spreading the Catholic faith, just 45% Catholic Republicans say so. And as of early 2018, nearly twice as many Democrats (71%) as Republicans (37%) said Pope Francis represents a major change for the better.
