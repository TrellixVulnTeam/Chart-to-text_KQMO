Both Republicans and GOP-leaning independents (94%) and Democrats and Democratic leaners (92%) overwhelmingly see strong conflicts between the two parties, and seven-in-ten or more in both parties say they are very strong (75% of Republicans and 71% of Democrats). Liberal Democrats are more likely to say the conflicts are very strong than moderate and conservative Democrats (75% vs. 66%). Similarly, conservative Republicans more often say this than moderate and liberal Republicans (80% vs. 65%).
Americans are now substantially more likely to see very strong conflicts between Democrats and Republicans than they were in the past. When the Center first asked the question in December 2012, 47% of Americans characterized partisan conflicts as very strong. Four years later, in December 2016, 56% said this, and 71% see these conflicts as very strong today.
