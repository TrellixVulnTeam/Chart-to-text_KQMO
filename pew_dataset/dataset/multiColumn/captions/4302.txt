In raw numbers, Turkey hosted more refugees than any other country last year: almost 1.6 million (or about 2% of the country’s population), including more than 1.5 million refugees from Syria and about 25,000 from Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. (The total number of refugees in Turkey has since grown to 2 million, but they’re not allowed to seek permanent asylum there. Some experts say Turkey’s policy contributes to the surge of refugees into European Union countries with more liberal asylum standards.)
Other nations adjoining conflict zones with significant refugee populations relative to their populations are Chad (4%), which borders Sudan; Djibouti, next to Somalia (2.5%); and Mauritania (2.2%), which is sandwiched between two conflict areas, northern Mali and Western Sahara.
