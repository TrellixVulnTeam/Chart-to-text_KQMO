When thinking specifically about women seeking high political office, men are somewhat more likely than women to say having children early gives women a better chance of succeeding – 56% vs. 47%. Still, 24% of men and 29% of women say a woman should wait until she’s well established, politically, before having children. Smaller shares of both groups say women are most successful in politics if they don’t have children.
