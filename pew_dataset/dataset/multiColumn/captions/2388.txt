Merkel gets positive reviews from Americans, especially Democrats. Since Pew Research Center first asked about Angela Merkel in the U.S. in 2006, three main findings have stood out. First, positive ratings for Merkel have consistently outweighed negative ones, and this was true again in 2017, when 56% of U.S. adults expressed confidence in her. Second, Merkel has become better known. In 2017, only 14% offered no opinion about the German leader, down from 31% as recently as 2012. Third, a partisan divide has emerged over Merkel. In 2012, there was virtually no difference in the views of Democrats and Republicans, but in 2017, 64% of Democrats had confidence in the chancellor, compared with 50% of Republicans.
