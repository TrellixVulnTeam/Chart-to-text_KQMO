Republicans and Democrats have long been divided in their views of labor and business, and that remains the case today: Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are much more favorable toward labor unions than business corporations, while the inverse is true for Republicans and Republican leaners.
Currently, 76% of Democrats hold a favorable view of unions, while only two-in-ten express an unfavorable one. Among Republicans, fewer than half (44%) say they have a favorable opinion of labor unions.
On the other hand, seven-in-ten Republicans express a positive opinion of business corporations. Democrats are divided: Roughly equal shares say they have a favorable view of business (46%) and an unfavorable one (47%).
