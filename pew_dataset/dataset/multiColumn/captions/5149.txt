A new report released today by the Pew Research Center shows how the values Americans bring to parenting are strongly linked to their own ideological leanings. But aside from ideology, the survey finds widespread agreement among parents over the traits that children should be taught.
Fully 94% of parents say it is important to teach children responsibility, while nearly as many (92%) say the same about hard work. Helpfulness, good manners and independence also are widely viewed as important for children to learn, according to the survey.
When parents were asked which traits they considered to be “most important” to teach children, the same ones topped the list, with one exception — while only 56% of parents say passing on religious faith is important, fully 31% say this is one of the most important things to teach children. That makes teaching religious faith the third most important trait, behind responsibility and hard work.
