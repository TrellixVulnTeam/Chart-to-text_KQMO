About two-thirds of Black (65%) and Hispanic voters (65%) said it is at least somewhat important to them to hear from the Trump and Biden campaigns. Among white voters, 55% said this.
Differences also emerge by age. About four-in-ten voters ages 65 and older (39%) said it is very important to them to hear from the presidential campaigns, compared with 30% of those 50 to 64, 20% of those 30 to 49 and just 15% of those ages 18 to 29. Slightly more 18- to 29-year-old voters (37%) said it is somewhat important to them, compared with roughly three-in-ten saying the same in the other age groups.
