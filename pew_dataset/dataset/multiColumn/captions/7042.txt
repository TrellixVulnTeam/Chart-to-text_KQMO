More than seven-in-ten (73%) Americans say the health care debate affects them personally, down slightly from the 78% that said the same in mid-July. In the current survey, 26% say it does not affect them personally, up slightly from 21% in July.
Nearly all Americans (93%) view the issue as important, about the same as the 95% that said the issue was important in July. More than seven-in-ten (72%) say the issue is interesting, matching the proportion in the earlier survey, 26% see it as boring.
Still, interest and media coverage notwithstanding, 67% say the health care debate remains hard to understand. Thatâ€™s about the same as the 63% that said the issue was hard to understand in mid-July. About three-in-ten (31%) say health care reform is easy to understand, little changed since July.
