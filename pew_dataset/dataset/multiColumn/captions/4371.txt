Over the past two decades, the share of students graduating from public high schools who are white and non-Hispanic has declined dramatically â€“ from 73% in 1995 to 57% in 2012, according to the most recent data available. In that time period the shares that are Hispanic and Asian have grown. WICHE projects that this trend will continue, with the public high school graduating class of 2025 being barely majority white (51%).
