The graph below shows how liberals and conservatives in Congress shared stories from different outlets, focusing only on the news outlets that were linked to most often (200 times or more) over the study period. A narrow boxed range in the graphic indicates the extent to which the outlet was linked to by liberals or conservatives in Congress. For example, Breitbart news was linked to nearly 700 times among Republican lawmakers (particularly more conservative Republicans) during the study period, and zero times by Democrats in Congress. On the opposite side of the spectrum, there were more than 1,100 links to the Huffington Post by congressional Democrats, but only 89 from Republican lawmakers. In contrast, outlets with a very wide boxed range – such as The Washington Post, The Hill and CNN – were linked to often by both liberals and conservatives in Congress. For example, news links to CNN were shared 1,011 times by Democrats in Congress during the study period, and 1,062 by congressional Republicans.
After Trump won the 2016 presidential election, Democrats in Congress became increasingly likely to share national news on Facebook. Between Jan. 2, 2015, and Nov. 8, 2016 – the day of the presidential election – just 8% of congressional Democrats’ Facebook posts included links to national news stories. From Jan. 20 through July 20, 2017, however, that number doubled to 16%.
