Our most recent panel survey, conducted Sept. 9-Oct. 3 with 3,154 adults — including 2,150 likely voters — checks back in with Americans interviewed for the political typology study. It finds that the two strongest Republican groups – the Business Conservatives and the Steadfast Conservatives – are more motivated to vote than other groups, with 67% and 66%, respectively, likely to turn out. Steadfast Conservatives are staunch critics of government and are socially conservative. Business Conservatives prefer limited government, but are far more moderate on social issues than Steadfast Conservatives and favor immigration reform. We estimate that these two groups constitute only 22% of the general public, but because they are so engaged with politics, these groups make up 38% of the likely electorate.
On the left, the Solid Liberals are solidly Democratic in their vote preference (93%) among likely voters and are uniformly liberal across nearly every realm – government, the economy, business, the environment and foreign policy, as well as on social issues. But they are somewhat less likely than the two conservative groups to vote; we forecasted that 54% of them will turn out to vote.
