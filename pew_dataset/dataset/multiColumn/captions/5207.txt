Though a majority of people in Pakistan are still unhappy with the countryâ€™s direction, satisfaction is on the rise. A quarter of Pakistanis are satisfied with the way things are going in their country, an increase of 17 percentage points from 2013 when just 8% held this view. Pakistanis are more satisfied with the direction of their country than they have been in six years. Men are slightly more likely to express satisfaction (29%) than women (20%).
