Looking ahead, there is shared optimism about scientific efforts to confront COVID-19. Large majorities of U.S. adults, and members of both parties, expect the year ahead to include an effective treatment or cure for COVID-19 (83%) as well all as a vaccine to prevent the disease (73%). And 72% of U.S. adults say they would definitely (42%) or probably (30%) get a coronavirus vaccine if one were available today, while about a quarter (27%) say they would not. Majorities across a range of demographic groups say they would get the vaccine. Most Democrats say they would get vaccinated by a margin of 79% to 21%. Republicans are slightly less inclined; 65% say they would definitely or probably get a vaccine while 34% say they would decline.
