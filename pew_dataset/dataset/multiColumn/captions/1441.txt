The new survey finds that partisans are starkly divided in their perceptions of how seriously the Trump administration is trying to prevent Russian interference in future U.S. elections.
A large majority of Republicans (81%) say they are very or somewhat confident the administration is making a serious effort to prevent future Russian interference, with 49% saying they are very confident â€“ an 11-point increase since March 2018. Only 17% say they are not too or not at all confident.
In contrast, 83% of Democrats say they are not too or not at all confident that the administration is making a serious effort to prevent Russian interference. Only 15% say they are very or somewhat confident.
