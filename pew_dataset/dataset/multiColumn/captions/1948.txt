When asked to rate the degree of long-term health risk to the average person from eating four types of foods – each with a different kind of additive introduced at some stage during food production – most Americans report at least “some” risk from meat from animals given hormones or antibiotics, or produce grown with pesticides, as well as food and beverages with artificial preservatives or coloring. Public concern is highest for meat from animals given antibiotics or hormones and produce grown with pesticides (32% and 31%, respectively, consider each to pose “a great deal” of health risk to the average person) followed by food and beverages with artificial preservatives (26%) or artificial coloring (21%).
