ISIS is seen as the top threat on both sides of the Atlantic. Eight-in-ten Americans say the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria is a major threat to the U.S., similar to the median of 76% across the 10 EU nations polled. Concern about ISIS is particularly high in Spain (93% say it is a major threat) and France (91%).
Americans and Europeans may agree ISIS is a top threat, but they differ in how they rank other concerns. For example, while climate change is the second biggest concern in Europe, it is lower on the list in the U.S. Instead, Americans name cyberattacks as the second greatest threat. China’s emergence as a world power rates relatively low in both the U.S. and Europe, although Americans are more concerned than Europeans about Beijing’s growing power.
