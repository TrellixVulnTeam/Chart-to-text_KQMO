Our analysis looks at the number of calendar days spent in session for each two-year Congress using the Brookings Institution’s Vital Statistics on Congress database for the Senate and archival records for the House. We began our analysis with the 92nd Congress because it was the first to convene following the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970, which mandates that both chambers recess in August. (The act grants each chamber’s leadership discretion to shorten its recess at any time.)
The average length for both chambers’ election year summer recess has roughly doubled since the 1970s and early ’80s. During election years between 1972 and 1982, the Senate spent an average of 16 days in August recess, and the House an average of 17 days. More recently, the Senate was in August recess for an average of 38 days in even years from 2006 to 2016, compared with an average of 36 days for the House.
