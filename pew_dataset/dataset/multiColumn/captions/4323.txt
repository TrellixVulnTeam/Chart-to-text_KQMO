Catholics in these three metro areas all tend to have at least somewhat higher household incomes than do U.S. Catholics overall, perhaps reflecting the higher cost of living in these areas. Catholics in the D.C. area have especially high incomes: 29% of Washington Catholics report household incomes of $100,000 per year or more, compared with 19% of all U.S. Catholics who are in this income bracket.
