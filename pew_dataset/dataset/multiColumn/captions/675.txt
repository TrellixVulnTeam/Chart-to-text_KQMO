China’s reputation among Americans had already fallen to an all-time low in Pew Research Center polling as of March, with roughly two-thirds viewing the country unfavorably. Now, a survey conducted April 29 to May 5 finds that Americans expect China’s international reputation will suffer because of how the country has handled the coronavirus outbreak, which originated within its borders. Americans are also critical of how China has handled the global pandemic and are skeptical of information from the Chinese government.
Americans are very critical of the way China has handled the coronavirus outbreak. Nearly two-thirds of Americans say China has not handled the global pandemic well, rating its performance as the worst (alongside Italy) among the six countries asked about in the April and May survey. And more give China the lowest possible rating – poor – for its dealings with the coronavirus than they do any other country (37%, compared with 27% who said the same of Italy).
