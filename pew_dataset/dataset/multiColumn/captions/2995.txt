Russian President Vladimir Putin gets high marks on foreign affairs. Overall, nearly nine-in-ten Russians say they are confident in their president’s ability to do the right thing in world affairs, with 58% expressing a lot of confidence.
When it comes to bilateral relationships, Russians give Putin high ratings on his handling of relations with the U.S. (73% approve), the EU (67%) and Ukraine (63%). But these ratings are down substantially from 2015, when 85% approved of Putin’s handling of the U.S., 82% approved of EU relations and 83% approved of Ukrainian relations.
Putin gets his highest marks on managing relations with China (78% approval), a country with which Russian relations have become markedly friendlier in recent years. However, even that figure is down 12 percentage points compared with 2015.
