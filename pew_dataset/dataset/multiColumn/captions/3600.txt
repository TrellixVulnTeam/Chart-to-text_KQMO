Many conservative Republicans have a negative view of scientistsâ€™ understanding of climate change. Majorities of conservative Republicans say climate scientists have little or no understanding of the causes of climate change or ways to address it. In comparison, majorities of the other political groups, including moderate and liberal Republicans, say climate scientists understand the causes of climate change and ways to address it very or fairly well.
