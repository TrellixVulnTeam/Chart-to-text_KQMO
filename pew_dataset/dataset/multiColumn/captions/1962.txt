What’s striking in some countries is the role partisanship plays in evaluations of a country’s growing or diminishing prominence on the world stage. In the U.S., for example, 45% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say the U.S. plays a more important role as a world leader today than in the past – a marked change from 2016, when just 15% said this. Views among Democrats have moved in the opposite direction following the change of administration. Only around one-in-five (19%) think the U.S. plays a more important leadership role today than it did 10 years ago, down from 27% in 2016. About half of Democrats and Democratic leaners (49%) now say the U.S. plays a less important role today than in the past; in 2016, just 29% said this.
