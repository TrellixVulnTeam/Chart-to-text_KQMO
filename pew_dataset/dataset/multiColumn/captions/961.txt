Most Democrats think the federal government is doing too little to reduce the effects of global climate change, while opinions among Republicans are divided by ideology, generation and gender. Overall, two-thirds of Americans say the federal government is doing too little to address climate change, including 90% of Democrats and 39% of Republicans.
But Republicans differ widely in their views on this issue by ideology. About two-thirds of moderate or liberal Republicans (65%) say the federal government is doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change, compared with roughly one-quarter of conservative Republicans (24%).
