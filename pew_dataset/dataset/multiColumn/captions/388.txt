In the wake of the 2016 presidential campaign, Facebook users were more likely to press the “anger” button than the “love” button in response to lawmakers’ posts on the platform. But a new Pew Research Center analysis finds that this trend has shifted in recent years, and that lawmakers received more love than anger reactions to their posts in 2019 and 2020.
In both 2017 and 2018, Facebook posts by members of Congress received around 5 million more “angry” reactions than “love” reactions. But love reactions overtook anger in 2019, and lawmakers have received roughly 2 million more love than anger reactions in the first seven months of 2020.
