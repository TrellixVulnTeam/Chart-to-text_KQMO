In general, the public continues to say that good diplomacy, rather than military strength, is the best way to ensure peace. Nearly six-in-ten (58%) say good diplomacy is the best way to ensure peace; 30% say the best way to ensure peace is through military strength. These views have changed only modestly since the question was first asked two decades ago.
Younger people are far more likely than older Americans to view good diplomacy as the best path to peace. Majorities of those under 30 (75%) and 30-49 (62%) say this, compared with about half of those 50-64(50%) and 65 and older (47%).
