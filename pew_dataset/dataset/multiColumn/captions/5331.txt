Using the World Bank’s economic categorization of countries, most refugees are from low-income countries. In fact, the share of refugees from these poorer countries has increased slightly during the past decade, from 52% in 2002 to 57% by 2012. Top low-income origin countries include Afghanistan (2.5 million in 2002 and 2.6 million in 2012), Somalia (400,000 in 2002 and 1.1 million in 2012) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (400,000 in 2002 and 500,000 in 2012). The lower economic position of refugees is very different than most international migrants who increasingly come from middle-income countries.
Most refugees are not living in high-income or low-income countries. In fact, it is middle-income countries (often referred to as “emerging nations”) that are more likely to host refugees, from 51% of all refugees in 2002 to 57% by 2012. Examples of middle-income countries hosting a large number of refugees include Pakistan (1.2 million in 2002, 1.6 million in 2012), Iran (1.3 million in 2002 and 900,000 in 2012) and Jordan (1,000 in 2002 and 300,000 in 2012). By contrast, international migrants as a whole are increasingly living in high-income countries.
