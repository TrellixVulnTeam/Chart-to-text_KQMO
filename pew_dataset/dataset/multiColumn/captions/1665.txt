The survey – which, again, was largely completed before Barr’s report on the Mueller investigation – finds that 64% of Americans say that Trump definitely (33%) or probably (31%) has done something illegal while in office or when he was running for president. Only half as many (32%) say he definitely or probably has not done things that are illegal.
An even larger share (72%) thinks Trump definitely or probably has done something unethical – with 46% saying he has definitely done this.
