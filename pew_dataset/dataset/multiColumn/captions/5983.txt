Even amidst developments on the ground in Syria and the announcement of U.S. plans to aid anti-government groups there, the public continues to pay very little attention to news about Syria. In a separate survey conducted Thursday through Sunday, just 15% say they are following news about charges that Syria has used chemical weapons against anti-government groups very closely, far fewer than are following other stories such as the governmentâ€™s collection of communication information (35%) and news about the national economy (30%). In fact, 33% say they are following news about Syria not at all closely.
