Men and women who have used online dating sites and apps hold somewhat differing views about how widespread online harassment is on these platforms, according to the most recent survey. For example, while 32% of female users say people being harassed or bullied is a very common occurrence on online dating platforms, that share falls to 19% among male users. These gender differences persist across all age ranges.
Similarly, women who have used online dating platforms are more likely than men to say it is very common for people to receive sexually explicit messages or images they didnâ€™t ask for (55% vs. 42%). This gender gap is more pronounced among online daters under the age of 50 than among those 50 and older.
