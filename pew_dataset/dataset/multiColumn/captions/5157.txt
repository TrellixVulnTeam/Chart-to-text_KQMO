Only one-fifth of Americans believe that trade creates jobs compared to a median of 44% among people in advanced economies, 52% of those in emerging economies and 66% of those in developing countries, according to a new Pew Research Center 44 country global survey. The disparities are similar when Americans are asked if trade increases wages, with the U.S. public holding a far more negative view than people in most other nations.
