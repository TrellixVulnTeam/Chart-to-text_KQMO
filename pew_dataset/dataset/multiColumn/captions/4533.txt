After a difficult year in U.S.-Israeli relations, Obama’s ratings have fallen sharply in Israel. Today, just 49% of Israelis express confidence in him, down from 71% last year. Obama has had strong, and well-publicized, disagreements with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over negotiations with Iran, and Obama’s ratings are especially low among Israelis who identify with Netanyahu’s Likud Party (40% have confidence). Overall, eight-in-ten Israelis disapprove of how Obama is dealing with the issue of Iran’s nuclear program.
