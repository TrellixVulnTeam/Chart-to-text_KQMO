For instance, 79% of Americans say that restrictions on power plant emissions can make a difference in reducing the effects of global climate change. Three-quarters of U.S. adults (76%) say corporate tax incentives to encourage carbon emission reductions among businesses can make a difference, and roughly seven-in-ten (71%) say the same about tougher fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks.
Americans are somewhat less optimistic about tax incentives to encourage more people to drive hybrid and electric cars. About six-in-ten (62%) think this would make a difference in reducing the effects of global climate change.
