One demographic measure where the three metro areas are similar is the marital status of their Catholic populations. Nearly or roughly half of Catholic adults in New York (50%), Philadelphia (45%) and Washington, D.C., (45%) are married, similar to U.S. Catholics overall (52%). About one-in-ten Catholics in each area (and in the country as a whole) report that they are currently living with a romantic partner outside of marriage.
