Today, roughly half of both Democrats (47%) and Republicans (48%) express a favorable view of the Department of Education. This marks a shift from surveys conducted throughout the Obama administration, when Democrats were consistently more likely than Republicans to view the department favorably.
A similar pattern is evident in opinions of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In surveys conducted between 2010 and January 2017, there was a wide partisan gap in views of the agency: By margins of 20 percentage points or more, Democrats had more favorable views of the EPA than Republicans. That partisan gap is substantially narrower today.
