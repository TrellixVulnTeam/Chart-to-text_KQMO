Compared with Obama after five years in office, George W. Bush had a lower level of approval among his base – but more of them strongly approved. In December 2005, 82% of conservative Republicans approved of Bush while 65% said they strongly approved. In fact, Bush continued to have the support of 8-in-10 conservative Republicans into 2006 and 2007 and retained strong approval among 6-in-10. (See Bush’s five-year trend at the bottom of the post.)
