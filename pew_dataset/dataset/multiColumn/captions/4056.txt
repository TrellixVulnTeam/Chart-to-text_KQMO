People’s views about their own country’s potential use of torture are strongly correlated with their views about the U.S. government’s post-9/11 interrogation practices.
Countries with larger percentages of people who say their own governments would be justified in torturing terrorist suspects also tend to have larger percentages of people saying the use of torture by the U.S. government was justified after the 9/11 attacks.
