Despite that boom, a new survey of 1,300 local television news directors produced by RTDNA and Hofstra University paints a mixed picture of the staffing and spending patterns in local television news. The overall number of staff working in local TV newsrooms declined slightly in 2013, and salaries for on-air anchors and reporters stagnated. At the same time, news budgets were generally higher last year, and more stations than ever are now airing regular newscasts.
Salaries for on-air staffers were flat. The median salary for a news anchor dropped from $64,000 in 2012 to 62,500 last year. Meteorologists’ salaries were almost the same, at $55,500, in 2013 and $55,000 in 2012. But they are down from $60,000 in 2011. Sports anchors earned the same pay — $45,000 — in each of the past three years. News reporters saw a slight uptick — from $30,000 in 2012 to $31,000 in 2013 — but they earned $32,000 in 2011. The staffers who saw the largest increase in pay (10%) in 2013 were the stations’ graphic specialists, highlighting the growing value of those skilled at producing better storytelling TV visuals.
