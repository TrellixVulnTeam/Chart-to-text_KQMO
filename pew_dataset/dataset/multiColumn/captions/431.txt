The debates draw a lot of viewers. Although viewership of the debates as a share of the total TV audience has broadly fallen over the decades, they can still attract more people than just about any other campaign event (or televised event of any kind that doesn’t rhyme with “Looper Hole”). In 2016, the first Clinton-Trump debate drew a record 84 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, and 71.6 million tuned in to the third debate. By comparison, the final nights of the parties’ 2016 conventions attracted fewer than 35 million viewers each. (The Nielsen numbers included people watching at home on traditional TV channels; they didn’t count people who may have streamed the debates online or watched them at debate parties in bars and restaurants.)
The vice presidential debates are very much the undercard. In most years since 1976, when the candidates for vice president first had their own debate, the running mates have been runners-up when it comes to viewership. In 2016, for example, only 37 million people watched the vice presidential debate between then-Indiana Gov. Pence and Sen. Tim Kaine, 44% fewer than the viewership of the lowest-rated Clinton-Trump presidential debate (the second), which drew 66.5 million viewers. That was the biggest-ever drop-off between the vice presidential debate and the lowest-rated presidential debate.
