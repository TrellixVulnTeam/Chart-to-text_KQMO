With the presidential election behind them, Americans have turned their attention back to the nation’s economy. The economy was by far the public’s top news story last week.
Fully 56% of the public followed news about the economy very closely last week, and as many as 43% listed this as the single news story they followed more closely than any other. In particular, Americans are beginning to focus more closely on the problems facing the U.S. auto industry.
