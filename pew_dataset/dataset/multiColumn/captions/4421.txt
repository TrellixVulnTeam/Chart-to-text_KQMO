With a projected contraction in Brazil’s economy over the next 12 months, things look even bleaker for this year. Only 13% of those surveyed by Pew Research last spring say economic conditions are good. From 2013 to 2015, Brazilians’ perception of their economy fell by a staggering 46 percentage points.
Only six-in-ten Brazilians now have a favorable view of their own country, with 39% voicing an unfavorable opinion. This includes a sharp decline in opinion of Brazil in the past year, with favorable views dropping 17 percentage points since 2014.
