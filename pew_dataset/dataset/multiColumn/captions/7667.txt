The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, conducted Jan. 4-8 among 1,503 adults, finds only modest public expectations for this year’s State of the Union address. Just 30% think Bush’s speech will be more important than speeches in past years, down slightly compared with last year and 2004 (34% each); roughly half (47%) say Bush’s address will be about as important as the speeches of recent years. In January 2002, a few months after the 9/11 attacks, 54% said Bush’s speech that year would be more important. And the following year, as the war with Iraq loomed, nearly as many Americans (52%) felt Bush’s address would carry greater importance.
