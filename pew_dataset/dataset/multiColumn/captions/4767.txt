In a Pew Research Center survey conducted last month, Pope Francis enjoyed a 90% favorability rating among U.S. Catholics. In addition, Francis now is rated favorably by 70% of all Americans, up from 57% in March 2013.
Francis is popular even among those without a religious affiliation. Fully two-thirds of religious “nones” (68%) in the most recent Pew Research poll say they view the current pontiff favorably, up from just 39% in March 2013.
Francis also is liked by American Protestants. According to the most recent Pew Research poll, 74% of white mainline Protestants and 60% of white evangelical Protestants say they view him favorably.
