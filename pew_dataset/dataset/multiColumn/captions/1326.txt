The CPS also drills down to asking people exactly which members of their household use the internet at various places, yielding an estimate that 79% of U.S. adults personally use the internet from anywhere. Unfortunately, the CPS does not ask its respondents whether they personally access the internet using a cellular data plan. This CPS estimate lines up closely with the 2018 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which estimates that 79% of U.S. adults would say yes to a very simple question, “Do you use the internet?”
Another potential measurement wrinkle comes from the various types of activities people can engage in on the internet. Some might equate “using the internet” with web browsing alone, inadvertently excluding email. Someone who only checks their email via a standalone email client or a mobile app could potentially say they don’t use the internet. Fortunately, the NHIS also asks respondents whether they send or receive emails. If we combine this with the previous estimate, we get a slight uptick to 81% of U.S. adults who either “use the internet” or use email.
While these varied approaches to measuring internet use can be bewildering, they all tell roughly the same story when viewed over time. Whether the measure is internet access, home internet use, personally using the internet anywhere, or the Center’s composite measure which includes email and cellphones, more and more Americans have the internet than in previous years.
