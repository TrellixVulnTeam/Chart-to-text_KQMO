In the realm of human rights, Canadians clearly prefer the U.S. over China. More than half of Canadians (54%) say the U.S. government respects the personal freedoms of its people, compared with only 5% who say the same about China. Despite this, there has been a significant decline in Canadians’ views of America’s commitment to human rights in the past two years. In 2013, fully 75% in Canada said the U.S. government respected its own people’s rights.
