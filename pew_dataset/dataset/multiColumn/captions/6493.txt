The aftermath of Hurricane Irene was the top story for the public and the media last week, as flooding worsened in many East Coast states well after the storm winds had died down.
More than a third of the public (36%) say that the impact of the hurricane was the news they followed most closely. Another 23% say news about the struggling economy was their top story, according to the latest News Interest Index survey, conducted Sept. 1-4 among 1,001 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press.
News about Irene accounted for 20% of the coverage analyzed by the Pew Research Centerâ€™s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ), making Irene the most covered story of the week. News about the economy was not far behind, making up 16% of coverage.
