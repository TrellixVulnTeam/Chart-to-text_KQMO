Public support for conducting all elections by mail has increased sharply since the fall of 2018 – from 34% then to 52% today – with most of the change coming among Democrats.
Today, 69% of Democrats strongly or somewhat favor conducting all elections by mail, up from just 40% two years ago. About a third of all Democrats and Democratic leaners (34%), including 44% of liberal Democrats, strongly favor this proposal.
At the same time, Republican support for the measure has ticked up only slightly. About a quarter (26%) favored conducting all elections by mail in 2018, compared with roughly a third (32%) who say they support the proposal today.
