2) App response rates were lower than Web rates overall and for each of the 14 surveys we conducted. When conducting a new poll, survey researchers often go to a lot of trouble to find out how many of the people they targeted to take the survey actually end up completing the questionnaire, a concept referred to as the response rate. In this case, we found that those who were asked to take the survey on a Web browser were more likely to complete at least one survey than those using apps to take the survey, resulting in overall response rates of 84% and 58%, respectively. Part of this may be due to the fact that many panelists assigned to use the app had trouble using it because they didnâ€™t know what an app was, how to download it or how to use it even though they own a smartphone. In the future, we will take this into consideration because if fewer people use the survey app, this has implications for both the precision of the data collected and for cost.
3) App and Web respondents look similar demographically, and their answers basically did not differ. App respondents were somewhat younger, more likely to be from the Midwest and less likely to be registered to vote than Web respondents. Overall, app respondents looked slightly more like all smartphone users than did the Web respondents. In the final reckoning, though, both the app and Web respondents look similar enough in terms of demographics that either could be used to represent all smartphone users.
