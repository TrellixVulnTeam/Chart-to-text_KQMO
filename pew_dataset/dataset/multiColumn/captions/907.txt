Other white Christians also are fairly confident about the president’s handling of the outbreak – though they are not as united in their support as white evangelicals are. About six-in-ten white Catholics (59%) and white Protestants who are not evangelical (62%) are at least somewhat confident that Trump is doing a good job, although only about half in each group say Trump has assessed the risks of the outbreak correctly. Roughly four-in-ten in these groups say he hasn’t taken the risks seriously enough.
