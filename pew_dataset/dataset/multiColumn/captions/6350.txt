Most Americans continue to say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the nation’s economy, though the percentage hearing mostly bad news has ticked up since last month.
Nearly six-in-ten (57%) say they are hearing mixed news about the economy, 30% say they are hearing mostly bad economic news and 11% say they are hearing mostly good news, according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey, conducted April 5-8 among 1,000 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The survey was in the field when a new federal jobs report was released April 6 that showed worse than expected job growth in March but a slight dip in the unemployment rate to 8.2%.
In early March, 62% said they were hearing mixed news about the economy, while 24% said they were hearing mostly bad economic news. Just as in the latest survey, 11% said they were hearing mostly good news.
Public perceptions of the tone of economic news are not much different than they were one year ago. Now, though, the number hearing mostly good news – while still small – is double what it was last April (11% vs. 5%). Views of economic news turned much more negative last August, amid fears that the economy could be slipping back into recession. At that point, 67% said they were hearing mostly bad news about the economy
