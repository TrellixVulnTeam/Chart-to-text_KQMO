The death of pop star Michael Jackson continued to grab public attention last week, with Americans saying it was the story they followed most closely for the third straight week. Moreover, Jackson’s death was by far the week’s most talked about news story.
About three-in-ten (29%) say they followed Jackson’s memorial service and the controversy surrounding his June 25 death more closely than any other major story last week. According to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey, conducted July 10-13 by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, a quarter say they tracked Jackson news very closely. That’s equal to the share that said they were following this story very closely one week earlier and down only slightly from 30% just after Jackson’s death.
The aftermath of Jackson’s death was also the week’s most reported story, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism. With extensive coverage of the July 7 memorial service, as well as reports about alleged misuse of prescription drugs and a possible custody fight over his children, reporting on Jackson filled 17% of the newshole from July 6-12.
