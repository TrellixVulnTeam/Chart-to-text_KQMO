While some of the recommendations of the Verma Committee were implemented in March 2013, the public remains dissatisfied with the current laws and the police’s handling of rape cases, with roughly three-in-four saying that the current criminal code for dealing with such cases is too lax. Fewer than one-in-ten Indians rate the current laws as “about right” in dealing with cases of rape (7%). And only 6% of the public says that the police investigate these cases adequately. Meanwhile, 18% think that laws on rape are too tough, while 15% hold this view about law enforcement.
