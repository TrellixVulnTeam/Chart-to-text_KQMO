Even though many in Africa struggle to afford life’s basic necessities, there is still considerable optimism about the future. A median of 50% believe children in their country today will be better off financially than their parents. Just 37% think children will be worse off.
Optimism is especially widespread in Nigeria and Ghana, where nearly two-thirds say children will be better off. It is less common in Uganda and South Africa, where opinion is roughly divided between optimists and pessimists.
Egypt is the least hopeful among the African nations studied – just 22% predict children will be better off than their parents.
