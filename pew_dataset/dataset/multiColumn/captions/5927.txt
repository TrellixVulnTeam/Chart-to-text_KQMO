In addition, banks have raised billions in new capital, either on their own or because regulators leaned on them to do so. And they generally have stricter lending standards than they did before the crisis, though according to the Fed’s quarterly survey of senior loan officers they’ve eased up some in recent years. The net result: capital ratios that are well above their pre-crisis levels. The chart below shows one key metric, the “Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio,” as an average for banks in different size ranges.
The rules impose a new requirement on banks to hold “common equity Tier 1 capital” — mostly money paid in by common stockholders plus retained earnings — equal to 4.5% of their assets, with the latter weighted by their risk of default. Banks also will have to hold an additional 2.5% as a “capital conservation buffer” — essentially as a first line of defense for periods of financial stress — or face restrictions on paying out dividends to shareholders and bonuses to executives. Other regulatory capital ratios will be raised.
