Health care: About seven-in-ten Americans (69%) said reducing health care costs should be a top priority for the president and Congress this year. This reflects an 8-percentage-point increase from 2011, though is little changed from last year. Majorities in both parties placed priority on health care, though a larger share of Democrats (77%) than Republicans (59%) cited health care costs as a top priority. In the post-midterm survey, Democrats in Congress had a 23-point advantage over Trump in the public’s assessments of who’d have the better approach to health care (51% vs. 28%).
