These findings come from Pew Research Center’s new survey of 1,001 U.S. Muslim adults, conducted Jan. 23 to May 2, 2017. The poll follows earlier Pew Research Center surveys of American Muslims in 2007 and 2011.
The new survey indicates that the U.S. Muslim community is facing numerous challenges. Three-quarters (75%) of Muslim respondents, for example, say there is “a lot” of discrimination against Muslims in the U.S. (a view shared by 69% of Americans in general). Muslim women are more likely than Muslim men to hold this view (83% versus 68%).
