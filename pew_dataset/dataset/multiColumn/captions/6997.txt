By a 48%-40% margin, more Americans continue to say they think a health care reform bill will pass over the next year than say they do not think that will happen. Opinion on this question is virtually identical to that measured a week earlier. House passage of health care legislation late Saturday, Nov. 7, had little effect on public attitudes: opinions measured in the two days after passage were not significantly different than those measured in the two days leading up to the vote.
The partisan divide over the prospects for health care reform also remains. A broad majority of Democrats (62%) say they expect a bill to pass over the next year; about a quarter (27%) do not think reform will happen. Republicans and independents are much more mixed in their views: 42% of Republicans expect a bill to pass, half (50%) do not. Among independents, 43% think health care reform will happen over the next year, while a comparable percentage (46%) do not think a bill will pass.
