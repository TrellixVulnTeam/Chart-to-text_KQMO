Rural residents are more likely than people in suburban and urban areas to know all or most of their neighbors, but they arenâ€™t more likely to interact with them. Four-in-ten rural residents say they know all or most of their neighbors, compared with 24% of urban residents and 28% of suburban residents. But rural residents have in-person conversations with their neighbors about as often as those in other community types. Roughly half of rural residents (47%) say they have face-to-face conversations with their neighbors at least once a week, with similar shares of suburban (49%) and urban residents (53%) saying the same.
