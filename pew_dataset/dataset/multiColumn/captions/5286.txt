Negative ratings also extend to Obama’s handling of the U.S. economy. A 56%-majority disapproves of how Obama is dealing with the economy, compared with 40% who say they approve. While ratings of Obama’s job on the economy are poor, as they have been throughout much of his presidency, they have been worse at other points in his presidency, when disapproval reached into the 60s.
Similarly, far more disapprove (55%) than approve (36%) of Obama’s handling of foreign policy, though his current ratings are little different than they were last fall.
