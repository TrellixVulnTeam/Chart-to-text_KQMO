A 25-nation Pew Global Attitudes survey conducted in May-June of this year highlighted the extent of Obama’s popularity, especially among many of America’s traditional allies in Western Europe. A remarkable 93% of Germans said they had confidence in Obama to do the right thing in world affairs, as did 91% in France and 86% in Britain. This was a dramatic shift from 2008, when only 14% of Germans, 13% of the French, and 16% of the British had expressed confidence in then President George W. Bush.
But Europeans weren’t alone — more than 80% in Canada, Japan and South Korea expressed confidence in Obama. Majorities in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico, where Bush had been overwhelmingly unpopular, also gave Obama positive marks. And even in countries where Bush had been relatively popular, such as India and Nigeria, Obama’s ratings were higher.
