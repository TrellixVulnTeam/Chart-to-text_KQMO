In many of the countries surveyed, people also tend to think their nation has positive economic relations with both the U.S. and China. For example, eight-in-ten Israelis give a positive evaluation of the economic ties between their country and China as well as the U.S., and at least half or more say the same in Australia (72%), Kenya (64%), Nigeria (62%), the Philippines (58%) and South Africa (52%).
South Korea stands out as the only country in which a plurality of people say current economic ties with the U.S. are positive, while those with China are negative (37%). In contrast, Lebanese (39%) and Turks (30%) are more likely to see positive economic relations with China and not the U.S., though these publics are relatively divided.
