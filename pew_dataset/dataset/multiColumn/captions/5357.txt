Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff receives overwhelmingly negative ratings for her handling of important issues facing the country. And while about half say the president is having a positive influence on the way things are going in the country, this is in sharp contrast to opinions of Rousseff’s predecessor and supporter, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, in the last year of his two-term presidency. In 2010, more than eight-in-ten (84%) said Lula was having a positive impact on Brazil.
