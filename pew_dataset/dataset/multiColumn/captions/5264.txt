Most Americans still are not inclined to view Russia as an adversary, though the share saying Russia represents a serious problem has continued to increase, according to a new survey from the Pew Research Center.
Currently, 26% of the public says that Russia is an adversary, while 49% think it is a serious problem but not an adversary, and just 15% say it is not much of a problem.
These opinions have changed only modestly since March, shortly after Russiaâ€™s annexation of Crimea. The share saying Russia is an adversary is unchanged since then, while the share saying Russia is a serious problem has increased six percentage points, from 43% to 49%.
Since last November, however, there has been a substantial change in public views of Russia. Currently, 75% view Russia either as an adversary or a serious problem, up from 54% in November. And the proportion viewing Russia as not much of a problem has fallen by more than half, from 40% then to just 15% today.
