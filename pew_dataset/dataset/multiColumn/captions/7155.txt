Last week, the public continued to track a number of economic policy developments very closely. Final passage of the $787 billion economic stimulus legislation was the top story in terms of news interest. Roughly four-in-ten (41%) say they followed final action on the economic stimulus bill very closely, while 35% named this story as the news item they followed most closely – by far the highest percentage for any of the week’s stories.
