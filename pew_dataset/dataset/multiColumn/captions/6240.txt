The big question this year will be how many Hispanics, as well as how many in the public overall, turn out to vote. Currently a record number of Hispanics – 23.4 million – are eligible to vote. That’s up from 19.5 million in 2008. And along with the growing number of potential voters, the actual number of Hispanic voters in presidential – and midterm – elections has been on the rise. A record 9.7 million voted in 2008.
