The public is divided over how active a role they see Trump playing in his administration: 50% say Trump will be in charge of what goes on in his administration most of the time, while 43% say other people will be really running the government.
In January 2001, following the election of George W. Bush, a CBS/New York Times survey found that 38% thought Bush would be in charge of what goes on in his administration most of the time, compared with 53% who said other people would be really running the government.
Views of Trumpâ€™s role vary greatly by partisan affiliation, as well as age. Three-quarters of Republicans and Republican leaners say Trump will be in charge of his administration, including 83% of conservative Republicans and a somewhat smaller 61%-majority of moderate and liberal Republicans.
Young adults under age 30 do not think Trump will be in charge most of the time: 64% say other people will really be running the government. By contrast, 67% of those ages 65 and older say that Trump will be in charge of what goes on in his administration most of the time.
