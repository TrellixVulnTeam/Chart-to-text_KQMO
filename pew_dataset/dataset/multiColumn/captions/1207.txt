More veterans say the military did a good job preparing them for life in the service than it did in readying them for the transition to civilian life. Veterans across eras offer similarly positive evaluations of the job the military did preparing them for military life, but less so when it comes to the return to civilian life. Roughly nine-in-ten veterans (91%) say the training they received when they first entered the military prepared them very or somewhat well for military life. By contrast, about half (52%) say the military prepared them very or somewhat well for the transition to civilian life.
