In 2014, the public was divided over the role of the government in the health care system – 47% said the government was responsible for making sure all Americans have health care coverage, while 50% said it was not. The public subsequently grew more supportive of the government ensuring that all Americans had health care coverage. Since last fall, however, there has been a 7 percentage point drop (from 60% to 53%) in the share of Americans who say this.
The share of Republicans and Republican leaners holding the view that ensuring health care coverage is the government’s responsibility has decreased by 9 points since September 2018, from 29% to 20%. Democratic views have not changed significantly over the past year – in September 2018, 85% said making sure all Americans have health care coverage was the federal government’s responsibility; 81% say this today.
