Through the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Presidentâ€™s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and other programs, the U.S. provides assistance to many African nations, and the 2013 Pew Research poll found a widespread belief that U.S. economic aid is having a positive impact. More than half in all six nations surveyed said American aid was having a beneficial effect on their country. Outside of sub-Saharan Africa, U.S. assistance is not always viewed so positively: The same question was asked in Egypt and Pakistan, where only 24% and 8%, respectively, saw American aid in a favorable light.
