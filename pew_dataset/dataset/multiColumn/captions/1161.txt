Catholics and Protestants also express varying levels of confidence in their clergy’s advice about personal issues and religious topics. Only three-in-ten Catholics, for instance, say they have “a lot” of confidence in their clergy’s guidance about marriage and relationships. Larger shares of evangelical Protestants (66%), Protestants in the historically black tradition (54%) and mainline Protestants (45%) say the same. And Catholics are much less likely than Protestants overall to trust their religious leaders to give useful advice on parenting (23% vs. 49%, respectively).
However, both Protestants and Catholics express fairly low levels of confidence in their clergy to provide guidance on political topics such as abortion, immigration and global climate change. While Pope Francis regularly speaks about immigration and climate change, small shares of Catholic Mass-goers have a lot of confidence in their clergy’s guidance on immigration (16%) and global climate change (8%). Among Protestants, one-in-five or fewer have a lot of confidence in their clergy to provide guidance on these issues.
