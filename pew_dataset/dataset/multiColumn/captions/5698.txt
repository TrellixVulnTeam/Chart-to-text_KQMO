The share of Americans with a positive view of the federal government fell to 28% in April, five points lower than the previous year, while public favorability of state government ticked up five points to 57%. Fully 41% of Democrats held favorable views of the federal government, compared with only 13% of Republicans. By contrast, state and local governments are viewed favorably across party lines: 56% of Democrats and 57% of Republicans said they had a favorable opinion of their state government. But the partisan makeup of the state government matters: Republicans give more positive ratings to GOP-led state governments, while Democrats rate Democratic-led state governments more highly.
Similarly, local governments also received positive ratings, with 67% of Democrats and 63% of Republicans seeing them favorably.
