Most in the region worry about China’s growing military power. China’s official military budget grew by about 9% per year over the past decade, and few of its neighbors appear to welcome the increase. In South Korea, Japan and Vietnam – countries actively engaged in disputes with China over military deployments or territory in the East and South China seas – nine-in-ten or more think China’s growing military power is a bad thing for their country. In India, even before a recent border dispute in the Himalayas, people had a negative view of Beijing by a more than three-to-one margin.
