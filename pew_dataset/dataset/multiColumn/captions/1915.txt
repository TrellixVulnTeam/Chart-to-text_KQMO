A similar pattern emerges when looking at annual income: 16% of those with an annual family income less than $30,000 say they feel lonely all or most of the time, compared with 9% of middle-income adults and 6% of higher-income adults.
While loneliness is more common among some groups than others, the share of people who feel this way is fairly consistent across most major demographic groups. Roughly one-in-ten Americans say they feel lonely all or most of the time across gender, racial and ethnic, and age groups. There are few differences by community type or party affiliation. In addition, even parental status and the number of years spent living in a community arenâ€™t strongly correlated with feelings of loneliness or isolation.
