While conflicts between Democrats and Republicans are perceived as strong by the vast majority of Americans, partisans generally agree on this point. Nine-in-ten Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (90%) say there are strong or very strong partisan conflicts, as do roughly as many Republicans and Republican leaners (87%).
Democrats are substantially more likely than Republicans to see strong conflicts between blacks and whites and between the rich and the poor. About three-quarters (74%) of Democrats and Democratic leaners see strong or very strong conflicts between blacks and whites, compared with slightly more than half (54%) of Republicans and Republican leaners. And while about seven-in-ten Democrats and Democratic leaners (69%) see strong or very strong conflicts between the rich and the poor, fewer than half of Republicans and GOP leaners (44%) agree.
