Large majorities of teens say that preventing people with mental illnesses from purchasing guns and improving mental health screening and treatment – 86% each – would be at least somewhat effective at preventing school shootings. Roughly eight-in-ten teens (79%) say that having metal detectors in schools would be effective and 66% say the same about banning assault-style weapons.
By contrast, a much smaller share of teens (39%) say that allowing teachers and school officials to carry guns in schools would be very or somewhat effective at preventing school shootings. Teens’ views on proposals to prevent school shootings generally mirror those of the general public, with the strongest support for mental health-related policies and relatively lower support for banning assault-style weapons or allowing school personnel to carry guns. (The survey did not ask about the effectiveness of having sworn law enforcement officers armed in schools.)
