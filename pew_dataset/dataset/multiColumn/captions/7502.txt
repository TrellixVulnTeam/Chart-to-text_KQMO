Aside from gas prices, news about the Iraq war continued to draw considerable public interest. A third followed news about the situation in Iraq very closely, while 23% said it was the story they followed most closely. In addition, 30% paid very close attention to the debate in Washington over U.S. policy in Iraq, and 10% said this was the story they followed most closely.
More than a quarter of the public paid very close attention to the debate in Congress over new immigration policy, and 12% listed this as their top story. Hispanics followed this story slightly more closely than did non-Hispanics (34% vs. 26% very closely). Republicans and Democrats followed the story in roughly equal proportions. The media devoted 10% of its coverage overall to the immigration debate, putting it on a par with the Iraq policy debate and events on the ground in Iraq.
The 2008 presidential campaign drew very close attention from 22% of the public. This was the fourth-ranked story in terms of public interest. The national news media devoted 6% of its coverage for the week to the campaign. The bulk of the coverage was on television and radio. The campaign was not a top ten story last week for newspapers or online news sources.
The recent violence in Lebanon between militant groups and the Lebanese army received as much news coverage as the presidential campaign and more coverage than rising gas prices (6% overall). This was the second most covered story online, with online sources devoting 15% of their coverage to the conflict. However, the public paid relatively little attention to the events in Lebanon; just 15% followed the story very closely and 2% said it was the story they followed most closely last week.
