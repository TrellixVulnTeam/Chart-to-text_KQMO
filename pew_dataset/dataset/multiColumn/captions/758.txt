Overall, about half of Americans (48%) say the current number of restrictions on public activity in their area is about right. Republicans and Republican leaners are much more likely to say that there should be fewer restrictions in their area (44%) than to say there should be more restrictions in their area (16%). Democrats and Democratic leaners are more likely to say there should be more restrictions (35%) than fewer (8%).
Republicans who live in states that are currently under stay-at-home orders are more likely to say there should be fewer restrictions in their area. About half (49%) of Republicans living in states under stay-at-home orders as of May 5 say this, compared with about four-in-ten Republicans living in states without such orders in place.
