The share of the population with military experience – counting those who are on active duty or were in the past – has fallen by more than half since 1980. Then, 18% of adults were serving or had served in the military. By 2014, the share had declined to 8%, according to Census Bureau data, with an additional 1% serving in the reserves. Among U.S. men, the decline was even more dramatic, dropping from 45% in 1960 to 37% in 1980 and 16% in 2014.
The number of people currently on active duty has also dropped significantly in the past half-century, falling from 3.1 million in 1966 – during the military draft era – to 1.3 million in today’s all-voluntary force, less than 1% of all U.S. adults. However, the decline in the share of the population with military experience has been driven primarily by the shrinking number of U.S. veterans as many pass away. In 1980, 18% of U.S. adults were veterans, compared with 8% in 2014, according to census data.
