The troubles facing the U.S. auto industry attracted similar interest, with 31% saying they followed those stories very closely. Interest in the auto industry’s problems was comparable in late February (33% very closely), when General Motors and Chrysler were seeking billions in federal loans to avoid bankruptcy.
On this scale, Obama’s trip measured similar levels of interest as the horrific shootings at an immigration services center in Binghamton, N.Y., last Friday. A quarter say they followed news of the trip very closely, compared with 26% for the New York killings that occurred the day the survey went into the field. The incident took place late in the week and took up 4% of the newshole.
North Korea’s testing of a long range missile was followed very closely by 23% of the public. That is similar to the share of the public that followed North Korea’s steps toward halting its nuclear weapons program last June (19% very closely). Only 8% say the missile test was the story they followed most closely last week. Also occurring late in the week, the missile test made up 2% of the newshole.
