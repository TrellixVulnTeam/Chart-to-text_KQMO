Strikingly, there is currently no major partisan difference in public views of the economy. But the more positive public assessment of the economy these days has been driven by changing Republican attitudes. Roughly six-in-ten Republicans (61%) and Democrats (60%) say conditions are very or somewhat good, with sentiment among GOP supporters roughly doubling in the past year. More than half (54%) of independents agree. Just a year ago there was a 26-percentage-point partisan difference on economic conditions, with Democrats being far more bullish on the economy than Republicans. This was the case throughout the Obama administration.
