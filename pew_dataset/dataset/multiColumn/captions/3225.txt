As President Trump prepares for his address next week to a joint session of Congress, Republicans say they are more inclined to trust the president, rather than GOP congressional leaders, if the two sides disagree.
In disputes with Congress, Republicans would trust Trump. About half of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (52%) say that if Trump and Republican congressional leaders disagree on an issue, they would be more likely to trust Trump. About a third (34%) say they would trust GOP leaders if they have a disagreement with the president.
