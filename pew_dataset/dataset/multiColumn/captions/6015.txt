Another outcome is that both the military and the general public agree that Americans donâ€™t understand military life. More than eight-in-ten (84%) of post-9/11 veterans say the public does not understand well or at all the problems that those in the military face. That view is shared by 76% of pre-9/11 veterans and 71% of the public.
