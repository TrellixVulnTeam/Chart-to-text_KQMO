Views of events in Russia’s history differ by the level of confidence in President Vladimir Putin. Russians who trust Putin to do the right thing on the world stage are more likely than those who express no confidence to name World War II as the most important event of the past century (35% vs 24%). This may reflect Putin’s efforts to promote the war as a defining moment for the Russian nation. Among the small share who express no confidence in Putin, the top historical event is the dissolution of the Soviet Union (30%), not World War II.
