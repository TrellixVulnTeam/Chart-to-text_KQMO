Republicans who turn to Trump for coronavirus news are also more likely than other Republicans to say the pandemic has been overblown, that Trump is getting the facts about the outbreak right and that public health organizations are not getting the facts right, according to the survey, conducted Aug. 31-Sept. 7 as part of the Centerâ€™s American News Pathways project. The poll was fielded before Trump tested positive for the virus and was hospitalized.
Respondents to the survey had earlier identified which of 10 types of sources they rely on most for COVID-19 news: Trump and his task force; international news outlets; national news outlets; local news outlets; state and local elected officials; public health organizations; Joe Biden and his campaign; friends and family; online forums; or community newsletters or Listservs. Among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, large differences emerge between those who rely mainly on Trump and those who rely mostly on other sources. But among Democrats and Democratic leaners, no one group of news consumers stands out in the same way.
