The public continues to be critical of both political parties. Both parties’ favorability ratings are more negative than positive and fewer than half say either party has high ethical standards. Majorities also fault both for their approach to government spending.
But as in the past, more say the Democratic Party “cares about the middle class” (57%) than say that about the Republican Party (42%). And while 54% say the Republican Party is “too extreme,” fewer (45%) say this phrase applies to the Democratic Party. The share saying the Democratic Party is too extreme has risen over the past year (from 37%) while perceptions of the GOP have shown less change.
