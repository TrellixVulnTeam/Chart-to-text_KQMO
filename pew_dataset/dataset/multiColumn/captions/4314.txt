Despite the sizeable differences between the Web and mail samples, most survey estimates produced by Web surveys will be a little different from those produced by surveys that cover the entire public. Of 406 separate estimates taken from nine waves of the American Trends Panel, just nine of them differed by 5 percentage points or more. Perhaps not surprisingly, all nine are related to internet or digital technology use. A Web-only survey estimated that 82% of the public uses the internet on a daily basis, while the full sample (including non-internet users) finds 69% go online daily. Similarly, there is a 10-point difference in the percentage of people who report having sent an email or text message to a friend or relative yesterday (79% among the Web sample vs. 69% among the full sample). There is also a 10-point difference in reported ownership of a laptop or desktop computer (90% of the Web sample vs. 80% overall).
