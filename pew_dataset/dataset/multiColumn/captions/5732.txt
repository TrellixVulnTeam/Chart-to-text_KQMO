In the Middle East, Saudi Arabia receives mixed marks when it comes to respecting the rights of its citizens. Only in Jordan (60%) and Egypt (59%) do clear majorities say the Saudi government protects the personal freedoms of its people. Elsewhere in the region, half or more take the opposite view.
However, in countries outside the Middle East that are home to substantial or majority Muslim populations, Saudi Arabia is generally given credit for protecting the liberties of its citizens. Half or more in Pakistan (65%), Senegal (63%), Nigeria (55%), and Indonesia (52%) say the Saudi regime protects personal freedoms within its borders.
By contrast, opinion of Saudi Arabiaâ€™s record on civil rights is highly critical in Europe, where as many as eight-in-ten or more in Spain (86%), Greece (84%), and France (81%) think the Saudi government does not protect the personal freedoms of its people. In North America, 74% of Canadians and 72% of Americans agree, as do 71% of Israelis.
