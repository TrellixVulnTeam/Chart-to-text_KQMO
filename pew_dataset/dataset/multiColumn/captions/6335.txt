Currently, 49% of Americans say it is more important to protect the rights of Americans to own guns, while 45% say it is more important to control gun ownership. Opinion has been divided since early 2009, shortly after Barack Obamaâ€™s election. From 1993 through 2008, majorities had said it was more important to control gun ownership than to protect gun rights.
