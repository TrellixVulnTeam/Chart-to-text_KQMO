Democrats will vote in a record 41 state and territorial primaries this year, four more than in 2008, the last year there was a wide-open nomination contest. (Guam calls its vote a caucus, but it operates more like a party-run primary.) Republicans will hold a total of 39 primaries, the same as in 2008 and one fewer than in 2012. Of the 41 states scheduled to hold at least one major-party primary (up from 40 in 2008), 35 will hold both Republican and Democratic primaries, though not necessarily on the same day.
The current system, such as it is, has evolved over more than four decades. Up to the early 1970s, ordinary voters had relatively little input into the parties’ presidential nominations: The nominees were chosen at the big national conventions, and most convention delegates were chosen by caucuses, local conventions, state committees or other forums dominated by party insiders and political professionals. Candidates entered primaries largely to demonstrate their voter appeal, rather than win delegates: In 1968, for example, only 15 states held primaries, which together sent about 40% of the delegates to each party’s convention.
