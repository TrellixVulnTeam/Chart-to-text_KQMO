It’s summertime, which means Americans are embarking on vacation trips to destinations near and far. One getaway in the “far” category would be a trip to space, something a host of private companies are trying to make possible. But it’s not an excursion that appeals to everyone – more U.S. adults say they would not want to orbit the Earth than say they would, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.
About four-in-ten Americans (42%) say they would definitely or probably be interested in orbiting the Earth in a spacecraft in the future, while roughly six-in-ten (58%) say they would not be interested.
Among the 42% of Americans who said they would be interested in traveling into space, the most common reason given (by 45% of those asked) was to “experience something unique.” Smaller shares of this group said they would want to be able to view the Earth from space (29%) or “learn more about the world” (20%).
Among the 58% who said they would not want to orbit the Earth aboard a spacecraft, equal shares said the main reason was that such a trip would be either “too expensive” (28% of those asked) or “too scary” (28%) or that their age or health wouldn’t allow it (28%).
