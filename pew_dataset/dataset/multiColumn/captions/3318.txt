And nearly identical shares say conservative Christians (52%) and lobbyists in Washington, D.C. (36%) will gain influence in Trump’s presidency as said that about the Bush administration (51% and 35%, respectively). Far fewer thought conservative Christians and lobbyists would gain under Obama (21% each).
As noted, however, smaller shares expect children to gain influence in Trump’s presidency than said that about Obama, Bush or Clinton before they took office. This also is the case in perceptions of how older people will fare. Currently, just 27% think older people will gain influence with Trump as president, while 35% say they will lose influence and 36% say they will not be affected.
