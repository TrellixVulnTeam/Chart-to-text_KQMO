Overall, the national news media devoted 37% of its coverage to the presidential campaign, making it by far the most heavily covered news story of the week. News that U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy was diagnosed with a cancerous brain tumor also drew considerable coverage (8% of all news coverage).
Once again, the public was focused much more heavily on the rising price of gasoline than on the presidential campaign. Nearly two-thirds of the public (65%) say they followed news about gas prices very closely last week; more than a third (35%) said the price of gas was the story they followed more closely than any other news item. The national news media devoted 6% of its overall coverage to this story.
