The number of minorities named to the federal courts has increased faster under Democratic presidents than Republican presidents. From 1945 to today – a period in which Republicans and Democrats have each occupied the White House for a total of 36 years – Democratic presidents have appointed three times as many black judges as their Republican counterparts (162 vs. 49). Democrats have also named more Hispanic judges to the federal bench (73 vs. 51). Still, eight-in-ten Democratic appointees have been non-Hispanic whites, compared with nine-in-ten Republican appointees.
Minorities are somewhat less likely to be represented in the nation’s 13 courts of appeals than in the 94 district courts, accounting for just 12% of appellate judges commissioned since 1945 and 15% of district judges. There has never been Native American or Pacific Islander representation in the appellate courts. Nearly half of the minority appellate judges were originally appointed to the district court and were later reappointed to a higher court.
