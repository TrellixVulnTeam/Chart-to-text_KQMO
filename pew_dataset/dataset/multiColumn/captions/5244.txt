Although there was little change in employment and compensation in 2013, there were some shifts in job duties for recent grads. The proportion of employed bachelor’s degree holders writing and editing for the Web dropped to 60% in 2013, down from 64% a year earlier. And blogging seems to be on the decline. In 2013, the percentage of recently employed graduates who were either creating or using blogs as part of their job was 27%—down from 36% three years earlier.
At the same time, producing mobile content is becoming a significantly bigger part of the work experience these days. In 2013, 17% of employed bachelor’s degree holders said they produced content for mobile devices, up from 13 % in 2012 and nearly double the 9% reported in 2011.
