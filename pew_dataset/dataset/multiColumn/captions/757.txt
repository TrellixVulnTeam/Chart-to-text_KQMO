Over the past month, conservative Republicans have become more likely to say their greater concern is that restrictions will not be lifted quickly enough. The 61% of conservative Republicans who now say this is up from 53% in another survey conducted April 7-12. Among moderate and liberal Republicans, by comparison, the 61% who now say they are more concerned that restrictions will be lifted too quickly is nearly identical to the 60% who said this in the earlier survey.
Democrats are more united than Republicans when it comes to their concerns about state-level restrictions. About nine-in-ten liberal Democrats (91%) say their greater concern is that restrictions will be lifted too quickly, a view shared by more than eight-in-ten conservative or moderate Democrats (83%).
