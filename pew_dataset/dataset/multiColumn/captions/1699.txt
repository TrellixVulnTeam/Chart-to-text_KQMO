The public sees tougher financial times on the horizon for older Americans. A majority of U.S. adults (57%) say those ages 65 and older will have a worse standard of living in 2050 than they do today. About seven-in-ten (72%) say older adults will be less prepared financially for retirement than their counterparts today. And an even larger share (83%) believes most people will definitely or probably have to work into their 70s to be able to afford retirement.
