Overall, more digital news consumers get their news online in the process of doing other things online (55%) than specifically seek out the news (44%), though there are differences by social media platform. About six-in-ten YouTube (58%), Facebook (62%) and Instagram (63%) news users get their news online mostly by chance while they are online doing other things, and they are less likely to say they were looking for news. However, Reddit, Twitter and LinkedIn news users are just as likely to say they seek out news online as to say they happen upon it.
