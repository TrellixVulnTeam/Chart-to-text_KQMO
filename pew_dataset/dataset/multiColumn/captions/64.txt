Between 1980 and 2000, immigration was the principal driver of Latino population growth as the Latino immigrant population boomed from 4.2 million to 14.1 million. Since then, however, the primary source of this growth has been U.S. births. Between 2000 and 2010, there were 9.6 million Latino births in the U.S., while the number of newly arrived immigrants was 6.5 million. The present decade is on track to repeat this pattern, with 5 million Latino births in the U.S. between 2010 and 2015, compared with just 1.9 million newly arrived Latino immigrants.
