By far the biggest single import is crude oil: The U.S. bought $246.5 billion worth of overseas crude last year. Along with various other petroleum products, natural gas and other energy sources, energy imports in 2014 totaled nearly $355 billion, according to our analysis of detailed trade data from the Census Bureau. (The country spent even more on computer, electronics and telecommunications equipment, which the Census Bureau splits into several different categories: $360 billion or more, depending on what you include.)
No single product category dominates U.S. exports the way energy does with imports. The country exports everything from civilian aircraft ($57.9 billion last year) to “hair and waste materials” ($660 million). But the nation’s energy exports have soared in recent years: They totaled $167.1 billion last year, versus $24.6 billion in 2004, mostly in the form of fuel oil and other petroleum products.
