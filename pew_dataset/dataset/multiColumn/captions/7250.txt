McCain may also have improved the GOP “brand,” which had steadily eroded during Bush’s second term. Half of registered voters now express a favorable opinion of the Republican Party – the party’s highest rating in three years. The Democratic Party continues to have a more favorable image (55% favorable), but the gap between the two parties has narrowed considerably since earlier this year.
Equally important, independent voters now express about the same view of both major parties: 50% of independents have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party while 49% feel favorably toward the Democratic Party. As recently as August, positive ratings for the Democratic Party surpassed the GOP’s by 18 points (56% to 38%).
