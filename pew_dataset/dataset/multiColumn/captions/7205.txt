With U.S. auto executives testifying on Capitol Hill and dramatic fluctuations on Wall Street, the public stayed focused on economic news last week. Fully 59% followed news about the economy very closely, up marginally from the previous week. Half followed stock market news very closely, only slightly less than the percentage that followed the market’s dramatic downturn last month.
In addition, 41% paid very close attention to the debate in Congress over a government bailout for the U.S. auto industry. Interest in the plight of the Big Three increased dramatically from the previous week, when 30% were following the problems of the auto industry very closely.
When asked which news story they followed most closely last week, 27% listed general economic conditions making it the public’s top news interest of the week. Some 15% listed the stock market as their most closely followed story, and 14% pointed to the potential bailout for the car companies.
