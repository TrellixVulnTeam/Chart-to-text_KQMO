Favorable opinions of both business corporations and labor unions have rebounded from record lows reached in the summer of 2011.
Overall, more Americans now hold a favorable (55%) than an unfavorable (39%) view of business corporations; two years ago, opinion was reversed (52% unfavorable, 38% favorable). Similarly, views of labor unions have returned to positive territory, with 51% holding a favorable view and 42% holding an unfavorable view â€“ far better ratings than the 46% unfavorable/41% favorable balance of opinion registered in 2011.
Public views of business corporations and labor unions, which had mostly been in positive territory from the 1980s through the early 2000s, turned less favorable during the economic recession. And in August 2011, amid fears of a new economic downturn and widespread dissatisfaction with national conditions, favorable ratings for business and labor hit all-time lows. Since then, favorable opinions of business corporations have increased 17 points and positive views of labor unions have risen 10 points.
