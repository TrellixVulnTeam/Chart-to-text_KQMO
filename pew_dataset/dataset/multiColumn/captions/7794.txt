The latest Pew Research Center survey of 1,919 adults conducted Sept. 5-10 (with an additional poll of 1,150 conducted Sept. 12-16) shows there has been virtually no movement in the congressional ballot all year. The generic House ballot stands at the same statistical dead heat as in June, with Democrats holding a thin 46%-44% edge among registered voters. When the sample is narrowed to likely voters, the Republicans lead 47%-46%. While the congressional poll did not cover the period of Bushâ€™s speeches on Sept. 11 and at the U.N., neither his soaring job approval marks early this year nor his declining ratings in late summer have significantly affected the congressional race. In fact, presidential approval has no greater impact on the generic ballot than it did four years ago.
