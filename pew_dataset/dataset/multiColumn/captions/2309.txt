Five Star and League supporters are more opposed to the European Union than the rest of the Italian public. Roughly three-in-four who support each of the two parties believe some EU powers should be returned to national governments. Further, majorities of both League and Five Star supporters say they feel this way strongly. Among the rest of the Italian public, a substantially smaller majority (55%) says some EU powers should be returned to national governments, and just 36% feel this way strongly.
Majorities of League and Five Star supporters also say that EU membership has been bad for the Italian economy (68% and 62%, respectively). But the rest of the Italian public isn’t so sure: 42% say EU membership has been bad for Italy’s economy, while 50% say it has been good.
