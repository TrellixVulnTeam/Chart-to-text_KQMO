The survey, part of a larger study to be released later this year about issues related to race, ethnicity and identity, also asked whether it’s ever acceptable for someone to wear traditional dress from a country or culture other than their own as part of a Halloween costume. About six-in-ten Americans (58%) say this is always or sometimes acceptable, while about a quarter (27%) say it’s rarely or never acceptable. Here, too, there are differences across racial and ethnic lines and between Democrats and Republicans.
