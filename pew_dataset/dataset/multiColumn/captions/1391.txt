People who use social media sites are also more likely today than in the past to describe the political discourse on these platforms in negative terms. Roughly two-thirds of users (68%) now say they find it “stressful and frustrating” to talk about politics on social media with people they disagree with, up from 59% in 2016. Conversely, 27% of users today say they find these interactions “interesting and informative,” compared with 35% three years prior.
The new survey also finds that users generally do not find common ground with others during online discussions about politics. Two-thirds of users (67%) say that discussing politics on social media with people they disagree with usually leads them to find out they have “less in common politically” than they expected. About a quarter (26%) report finding out they have “more in common” than previously thought. These shares are statistically unchanged from 2016.
