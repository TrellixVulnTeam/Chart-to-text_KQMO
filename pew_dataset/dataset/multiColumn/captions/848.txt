The questions explored in this analysis, part of a survey conducted Feb. 4 to 15, did not mention President Donald Trump or any other president by name. However, other questions in the survey asked about Trump specifically, including whether respondents consider him to be morally upstanding, honest or religious. Data from those sections of the survey show that Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say that “morally upstanding” and “honest” describe Trump at least fairly well. Republicans are also more likely to view Trump as at least somewhat religious. (For the full set of findings, read the report.)
