At the same time, the public has grown more negative about the situation in Iraq and President Bush’s handling of the war. Half of Americans now believe that the war in Iraq will turn out to be another Vietnam, while just a third think that the U.S. will accomplish its goals there. As recently as April, opinion on this issue was evenly divided (43% felt the U.S. would accomplish its goals vs. 41% who said it will be another Vietnam). And just 23% approve of President Bush’s handling of the situation in Iraq ­ down nine points since August. Bush’s overall job approval mark of 32% is unchanged from November, though it remains the lowest of his presidency.
The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, conducted Dec. 6-10 among 1,502 adults, finds that 52% currently describe the violence in Iraq as “mostly a civil war,” rather than an insurgency against the U.S. and its allies. While this is largely unchanged from September, it represents a major shift from a year ago. In December 2005, just 30% viewed the violence in Iraq as mostly a civil war while 58% said it was an insurgency aimed at the U.S. and its allies.
