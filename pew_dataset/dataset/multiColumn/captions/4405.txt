Mexico’s military continues to be highly rated, with about six-in-ten (61%) saying the military has a positive impact on the way things are going in the country.
While the military receives the highest ratings of the groups and institutions tested, views of the military have turned less positive since last year, when 75% said it was having a positive impact. Today the military’s ratings are similar to what they were in 2011 (62%), the peak year of drug-related homicides in Mexico. Trends in the views of police influence follow a similar pattern.
