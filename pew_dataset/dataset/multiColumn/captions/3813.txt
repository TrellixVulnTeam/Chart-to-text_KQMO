Other issues are seen as more important by backers of one of the candidates: Trump supporters are more likely than Clinton supporters to say immigration is very important to their vote (79% vs. 65%), though the importance of this issue across-the-board is substantially higher today than it was in 2008 or 2012. Conversely, though nearly eight-in-ten (79%) Clinton supporters view the treatment of racial and ethnic minorities as a very important issue to their vote, only 42% of Trump backers say the same. And while more than half of Clinton supporters (54%) say the treatment of gay, lesbian and transgender people is very important, just a quarter of Trump supporters agree.
Clinton is viewed as better able than Trump to handle several issues, including dealing with race relations (66% to 26% over Trump), better reflecting people’s views on abortion, making wise decisions on foreign policy, dealing with health care and selecting Supreme Court justices.
Yet voters are divided over which candidate can better handle the economy and terrorism – the two issues that rank at the top of voters’ agenda. Trump has a wide edge over Clinton as being better able to reduce the influence of lobbyists and special interests in Washington (50% to 30%).
