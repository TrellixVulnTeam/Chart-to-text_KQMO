A host of major news stories have been competing for Americans’ attention in recent weeks. But the public is more likely to have heard “a lot” about ongoing confrontations between police and protesters than several other stories, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Aug. 31 to Sept. 7.
Two other news stories asked about in the survey made less of an impression on the public. Three-in-ten Americans say they have heard or read a lot about the debate over whether professional and college sports should be played in the current environment, and only around two-in-ten (22%) say the same about discussions of the extent of child abuse and trafficking in the United States.
