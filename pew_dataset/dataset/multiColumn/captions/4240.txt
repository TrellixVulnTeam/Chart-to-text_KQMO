The only national institution asked about in the survey that has a positive rating from Turks is the military. About half (52%) of the public say that the military is having a good influence on the way things are going in Turkey, while 37% say it is having a bad influence.
Turks are divided on many of the other major institutions in their country. Nearly equal numbers say that the police, national government and religious leaders are either a good or bad influence. About four-in-ten (41%) say that the court system has a good effect on the nation, but 48% rate its influence as bad.
