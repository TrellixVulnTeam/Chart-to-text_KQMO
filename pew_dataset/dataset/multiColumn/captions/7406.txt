Women are personally more optimistic about the year ahead than are men. More than half of women (55%) say that 2008 will be a better year than 2007, while just 28% expect the coming year to be worse. Fewer than half of men (46%) are personally upbeat about 2008, while 40% expect it to be a worse year than 2007.
Young people consistently express more personal optimism than do older Americans, and this is reflected in their upbeat outlook for 2008. Two-thirds (66%) of those younger than 30 say this year will be better than last, compared with 50% of those ages 30 to 49 and slightly more than 40% for 50 and older.
