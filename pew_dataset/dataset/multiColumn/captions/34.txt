Digital advertising continues to grow as a proportion of total advertising revenue, a trend driven in large part by growth in advertising on mobile devices. The estimates below are for all digital advertising revenue, not just for news outlets, and thus are an indicator of the general direction of the economic health of the digital realm rather than the digital news sector specifically. (There is no publicly available economic data specifically for all digital-native news outlets studied above.)
In 2018, according to eMarketer estimates, digital advertising grew to $109 billion, an increase from $88 billion in 2017. It was estimated to comprise 49% of all advertising revenue, up from 43% in 2017.
