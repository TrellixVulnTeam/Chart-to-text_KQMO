In early September — amid high-visibility beheadings by ISIS and prior to a primetime speech by President Obama outlining strategy for dealing with the terror group— the public had become more skeptical of the government’s ability to reduce the threat of terrorism. A narrow majority (56%) said the government was doing very well or fairly well in reducing the threat, which neared a post-9/11 low (54% in January 2007).
Since September, positive views of the government’s handling of the threat from terrorism have jumped 16 points to 72%. That is comparable to the government’s ratings on terrorism during most of the Obama and Bush administrations. The share saying the government was doing very or fairly well in addressing the threat of terrorism reached 88% in October 2001, a month after 9/11 (48% said it was doing very well, 40% fairly well).
