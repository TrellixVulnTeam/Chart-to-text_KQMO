The Indians’ favorable view of the U.S. is similar to the opinion of America voiced by the Germans (51%) and the Chinese (50%) and certainly more favorable than that held by the Russians (23%) and Pakistanis (14%). But it trails the median view of the U.S. in the European Union (66%) and in other major emerging market economies: Brazil, South Africa and Indonesia. Moreover, nearly three-in-ten Indians voice no opinion about the United States — so the president has some salesmanship ahead.
