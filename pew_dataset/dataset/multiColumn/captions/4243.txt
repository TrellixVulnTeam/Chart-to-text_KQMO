Despite low ratings for the EU (just one-third of Turks have a favorable view of the institution), a majority in Turkey (55%) want to become a member while only 32% oppose joining the EU. This sentiment has held relatively steady in recent years, although in 2005, more in Turkey (68%) wanted to join the European project.
