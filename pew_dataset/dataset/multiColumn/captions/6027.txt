But it is also likely that the language and context of the question are substantial factors. Where the first three polls said the DOJ subpoenaed, obtained through a court order, or secretly collected the phone records, the Fox News question used the phrase secretly seized to describe the DOJ’s actions. The Fox News survey also pointed out that the records were extensive, included both work and personal phones, and that they did so without giving the news organization prior notice, as is customary. By two-to-one (60% vs. 31%) more said this action by the government went too far rather than was probably justified.
An additional factor that likely affected the responses to the Fox News question was the context in which it was presented. Immediately prior to asking about the legitimacy of the DOJ’s actions, Fox News asked: Does it feel like the federal government has gotten out of control and is threatening the basic civil liberties of Americans, or doesn’t it feel this way to you? There is a long track record in the survey industry of how framing a question in a particular context can affect responses, and there is little doubt that raising this broad criticism of government – which roughly two-thirds (68%) of respondents agreed with – prior to the DOJ question had some effect.
