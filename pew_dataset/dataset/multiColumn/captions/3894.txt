Much like ride-hailing apps, the legal and regulatory status of home-sharing services has been the subject of much debate in cities around the country. But in contrast to ride-hailing, relatively few Americans have been following the debate over home-sharing services: 22% of Americans have heard something about this issue, with just 6% indicating that they have heard “a lot” about it. Even users of home-sharing services themselves are not following this issue particularly closely: Just 19% of home-sharing users have heard “a lot” about it, while 37% have heard “a little.”
But although home-sharing users have not been following the legal debate over these services with nearly the same intensity as their ride-hailing counterparts, those home-sharing users who have been following this issue tend to feel that these services should be both legal and tax-free for owners. Among home-sharing users who are aware of the legal debate over these services, 56% believe that these services should be legal, and that owners should not have to pay any local hotel or lodging taxes; just 31% believe that owners should be able to legally rent out these services but should have to pay taxes for the privilege of doing so.
