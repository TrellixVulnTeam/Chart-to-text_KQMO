While the campaign once again dominated national news coverage last week, the economy took center stage in terms of public interest. Three-in-ten Americans paid very close attention to news about the presidential campaign last week, however, only 11% listed the campaign as the single news story they were following more closely than any other — putting it in fourth place behind the economy, the troubles facing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the situation in Iraq.
Fully 45% of the public followed news about the economy very closely and 29% listed this as their most closely followed story. News of the financial crisis facing mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the government’s efforts to shore up those institutions was followed very closely by 30% of Americans. Another 33% followed this story fairly closely and 15% listed this as their most closely followed story of the week. Republicans and Democrats followed the mortgage story in roughly equal proportions, but Democrats paid considerably closer attention than Republicans to news about the general state of the economy. For its part, the national media devoted 9% of its overall coverage to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and 9% to the U.S. economy.
