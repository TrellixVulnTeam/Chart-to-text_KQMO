Teens now spend about seven and a half hours a day engaged in leisure activities during the summer. While this still accounts for the bulk of their waking hours, it represents a 24-minute decline from a decade ago. This decline has been largely driven by a 22-minute drop in time spent socializing or going to entertainment or sporting events.
On the flip side, teens now spend 18 more minutes a day in active pursuits such as playing sports or exercising compared with teens a decade ago. What has not changed substantially is the amount of time they spend on screens in the summer: Teens now devote more than three and a half hours a day to activities such as gaming, watching TV, surfing the web and watching videos â€“ a figure that has ticked down only slightly in the past decade.
