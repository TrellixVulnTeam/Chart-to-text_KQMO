This marriage and education gap has widened as the share of high school graduates who are married has fallen more sharply than the share of college graduates who are married. In 2015, 45% of adults ages 18 and older with a high school degree but no college experience were married. This compares with 62% among those with a bachelorâ€™s degree or higher.
