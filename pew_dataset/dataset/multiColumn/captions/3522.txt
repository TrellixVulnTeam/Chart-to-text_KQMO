The exercise of military force has been controversial in Japan since World War II. The Japanese Constitution outlaws war as a means for the state to settle international disputes. A majority (62%) of Japanese say Japan should limit its military role in the Asia-Pacific region. Just 29% voice the view that Japan should play a more active military role in regional affairs. Notably, support for a more active military role is up 6 percentage points since 2015. Among the minority of Japanese who believe Japan should take on more military responsibilities, men (36%) are more likely than women (22%) to hold this view.
