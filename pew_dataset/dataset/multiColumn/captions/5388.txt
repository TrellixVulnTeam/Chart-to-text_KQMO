In 2012, according to analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, more than 30% of student-loan borrowers who moved into their repayment cycles were delinquent (that is, they’re 90 days or more behind in their payments), up from 20% just eight years earlier. That “effective delinquency rate,” which excludes people who aren’t yet on the hook to start repaying their loans, has risen among all age groups but is highest among borrowers younger than 30: 35% of that subgroup was delinquent in 2012.
