The view that a country protects freedom of speech informs how people feel democracy is working in their country. Perceptions of whether a country protects free speech are crucial in explaining dissatisfaction with democracy: People who say freedom of expression is protected in their country are less dissatisfied with democracy. However, thereâ€™s no relationship between dissatisfaction with democracy or the perception that freedom of speech is protected and measures of whether a country protects civil liberties, such as those compiled by Freedom House. Take Spain: The country receives a top score for protections of these rights, but only around half of Spanish adults (48%) believe their country protects their rights to free speech.
