Partisansâ€™ views of individual congressional leaders are deeply divided. Republicans and Republican leaners have much more favorable views of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan than do Democrats and Democratic leaners, and the reverse is true for Minority Leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi.
Schumer is not very well known, even among Democrats: 37% view him favorably, 26% unfavorably, while 36% have no opinion.
