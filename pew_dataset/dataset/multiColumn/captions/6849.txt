More than half of the public (56%) says they have a favorable opinion of Barack Obama, down from 65% in November 2009. About seven-in-ten (69%) say they have a favorable opinion of Michelle Obama, about the same as the 71% that said this in November.
Still, the latest Pew Research/National Journal Congressional Connection Poll, sponsored by SHRM, shows both Barack and Michelle Obama with somewhat higher negative ratings. Barack Obama’s unfavorable rating increased nine points from 30% in November to 39%; Michelle Obama’s increased six points from 16% to 22%.
