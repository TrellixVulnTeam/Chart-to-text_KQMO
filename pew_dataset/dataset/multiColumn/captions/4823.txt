There were just over 5 million job openings on the last business day of 2014 (after adjusting for seasonal variations), according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (known as JOLTS), which is produced by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. While that was little changed from November’s level, it was the highest figure since January 2001, just before the dot-com bust. While job openings have been increasing since the latter part of 2009, the pace accelerated markedly last year.
Employers hired more than 5.1 million people in December, according to the JOLTS report — again, little changed from November, but the strongest monthly showing since late 2007. Over the full year, hiring increased particularly strongly in the construction and finance/insurance industries — both of which had been hit especially hard by the housing bubble’s collapse.
