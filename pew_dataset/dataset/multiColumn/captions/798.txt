The share of Americans who favor conducting all elections by mail has risen 18 percentage points from 34% in the fall of 2018 to 52% today. Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents account for most of this overall increase.
Just prior to the 2018 midterm elections, four-in-ten Democrats said they favored conducting all elections by mail. Today, nearly seven-in-ten Democrats (69%) say this, including 34% who strongly favor vote-by-mail elections.
