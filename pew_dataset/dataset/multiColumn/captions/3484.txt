The demographic profile of veterans is also expected to change in the coming decades, reflecting the shifting demographic profile of the military in general. Between 2013 and 2043, the share of all veterans who are women will almost double, from 9% up to 17%, according to VA projections. At the same time, the share ages 50 to 69 is expected to shrink from 42% to 34%, while the share ages 70 or older is expected to rise from 30% to 36%. Mirroring trends in the overall U.S. population, the veteran population is predicted to become more racially and ethnically diverse, as well. Between 2013 and 2043, the share of non-Hispanic white veterans is projected to fall from 78% to 64%, while the share of Hispanic vets will likely double, from 7% to 14%.
