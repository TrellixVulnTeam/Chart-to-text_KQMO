Though most Americans focused on the oil spill last week, other stories also grabbed the public’s attention. More than four-in-ten (43%) say they followed reports about the condition of the economy very closely. This was the most closely followed story for 11%. The media devoted 6% of coverage to news about the economy, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ).

Reporting on this accounted for 5% of the newshole examined by PEJ.
About two-in-ten (19%) say they very closely followed news about tensions between North Korea and South Korea; 3% say this was the story they followed most closely. News about the tensions made up 3% of coverage.
