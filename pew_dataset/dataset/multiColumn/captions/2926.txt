Roughly one-quarter of Americans (27%) say they have chosen not to post something after witnessing online harassment, while a similar share (28%) say they adjusted their privacy settings after seeing this type of online behavior. Some users report going a step further: 13% of U.S. adults have stopped using an online service altogether after seeing others being harassed.
