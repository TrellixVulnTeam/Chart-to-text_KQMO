More than eight-in-ten Hispanics (86%) favor Congress passing a law granting permanent legal status to immigrants who came illegally to the U.S. as children. This comes as the U.S. Supreme Court evaluates the Trump administration’s decision to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), a program that has protected about 800,000 unauthorized immigrants who came to the U.S. as children – most of them from Mexico.
Hispanic Democrats (92%) and Republicans (77%) both broadly support Congress creating a path to legal status for immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children.
