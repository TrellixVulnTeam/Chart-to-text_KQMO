Europeans are not only the most negative about the present, but also the most pessimistic about the future: A median of 64% believe that today’s children, when they grow up, will be worse off financially than their parents. The French (85%) are particularly concerned about the future. Americans (60%) are almost as worried as the Europeans about prospects for the next generation.

The Vietnamese (91%) and Chinese (88%) are particularly hopeful. The Asians with the greatest doubts are the Japanese: Just 18% are hopeful for the next generation.
