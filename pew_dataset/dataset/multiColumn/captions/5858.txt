While the absolute number of U.S. elementary and secondary students seems to be on the rise, theyâ€™re making up a smaller and smaller share of the overall population: 17.4% this year, by our calculation, versus 19.4% as recently as 1999. But postsecondary students are increasing both in absolute and percentage terms: from 12.5 million (5.3% of the population) three decades ago to a projected 21.9 million (6.9%) this year. That trend is driven both by the aging population (kids who seemingly only yesterday were in first grade now entering college) and by adults continuing in, or returning to, higher education to retrain or refresh their skills.
