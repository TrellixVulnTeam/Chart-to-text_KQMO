The U.S. receives higher favorable ratings in Africa than in any other region. Our 2015 survey found mostly positive ratings for the U.S. around the globe, but they were especially high in Africa – across the nine nations surveyed in the region, a median of 79% expressed a favorable opinion of the U.S., while just 10% had an unfavorable view.
Obama is very popular in Africa. Big majorities in all nine African nations surveyed express confidence in him, including 80% of Kenyans and 65% of Ethiopians. Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush, also received mostly positive ratings in the region, and the rise in anti-Americanism that occurred in many parts of the world during the Bush era was largely absent in Africa.
