Americans focused most closely last week on news about the nation’s struggling economy and President Obama’s plans to draw down U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Two-in-ten (20%) say the economy was their top story, while 16% say they followed the discussions in Washington about troop levels in Afghanistan more closely than any other top story, according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey conducted June 23-26 among 1,005 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press.
Those two stories also topped news coverage last week, with the economy accounting for 16% of the newshole and Obama’s troop announcement accounting for 14%, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). PEJ noted that the long-running war has received only modest coverage in recent years, though media attention generally increases when war developments – such as a shift in strategy or military leadership – take place in Washington.
