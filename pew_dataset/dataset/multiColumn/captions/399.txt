On the more positive side, about two-thirds of Americans say the statements “social media highlight important issues that might not get a lot of attention otherwise” (65%) and “social media help give a voice to underrepresented groups” (64%) describe social media very or somewhat well. Half of Americans also say the statement “social media make it easier to hold powerful people accountable for their actions” describes these platforms at least somewhat well.
But even larger shares of the public think these platforms are distractions and that people may be engaging in “slacktivism” – a term critics have used to describe activism online. Roughly eight-in-ten Americans (79%) say the statement “social media distract people from issues that are truly important” describes social media very or somewhat well, while a similar share (76%) say the same about the statement “social media make people think they are making a difference when they really aren’t.”
Democrats are more likely than Republicans to see positive impacts of social media. For instance, three-quarters of Democrats say the statement “social media highlight important issues that may not get a lot of attention otherwise” describes these platforms at least somewhat well, compared with 55% of Republicans. Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to say these platforms help give a voice to underrepresented groups (75% vs. 52%) and make it easier to hold powerful people accountable for their actions (60% vs. 40%).
By comparison, there is more partisan agreement when it comes to some negative aspects of using social media platforms for political engagement. However, Republicans are a bit more likely than Democrats to believe that social media distract people from issues that are truly important (82% vs. 77%) or make people think they are making a difference when they really aren’t (80% vs. 74%).
