In Mexico, most of these issues were more important among people who earn an income above the median. Higher-income Mexicans were particularly likely to say guaranteeing gender equality, protesting police misconduct, promoting a clean environment, ensuring free and fair elections, guaranteeing fair trials and holding the government accountable on human rights issues should be top priorities.
Few see human rights organizations as tools of foreign powers. In recent years, several governments around the world have placed restrictions on foreign support for human rights groups and other nongovernmental organizations, with critics often charging that these groups serve the interests of foreign organizations. However, this is not a view shared by the four publics surveyed.
When asked whether human rights organizations are primarily dedicated to promoting the interests of foreign groups or protecting the rights of people in their country, strong majorities of Kenyans, Indonesians and Mexicans said such groups are dedicated to helping people in their country. In India, a 43% plurality said the same, though roughly three-in-ten did not offer an opinion.
