Most Americans continue to say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy (60%), but the number that says they have been hearing mostly negative news about the economy is up eight points since early March when it matched an earlier low.
At that point, 24% said they were hearing mostly bad news about the economy. That rose to 30% in early April and now stands at 32%. The relatively small number hearing mostly good news has dropped from 11% in April and March to 6% in the current survey.
