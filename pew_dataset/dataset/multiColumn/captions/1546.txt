Roughly a fifth of MEPs were “hard” or “soft” Euroskeptics from 1979 to 2009, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of EU election results. In 2014, the Euroskeptic share jumped to 29%, or 221 MEPs; it’s now 30%, due to membership changes and shifts in political groupings. In the Greek and UK delegations, in fact, Euroskeptics outnumber pro-EU members.
