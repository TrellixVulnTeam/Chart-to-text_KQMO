The military continues to receive high marks from the Mexican public. Three-quarters say the military has a good influence on the way things are going in the country; only 23% disagree. This opinion remains virtually unchanged from last year, when 72% praised the military’s influence.
Half or more also believe the media, national government, religious leaders and President Peña Nieto have a positive impact on the nation.
Meanwhile, fewer than four-in-ten give positive assessments of some other key groups within the country. Institutions and groups receiving the least amount of praise include corporations, the court system, the police, Congress and civil servants. Half or more say each of these has a bad influence on the way things are going in Mexico.
