The only country in the region where a clear majority says the U.S. takes their interests into account a great deal or fair amount is the Philippines (85%). About half (52%) of Indonesians share that view. A big majority in Australia (71%), which was one of the countries that was part of the administration’s “pivot” strategy, says the U.S. does not take its interests into account much or at all while more than half of publics in South Korea (62%), Japan (59%) and Pakistan (53%) share that view. Opinion is divided in Malaysia where the public says the U.S. does not consider its interests much or at all by a 44% to 38% margin. The U.S. does better in China itself where 49% says the U.S. considers their country’s interest a great deal or fair amount while 38% hold that opposite view.
