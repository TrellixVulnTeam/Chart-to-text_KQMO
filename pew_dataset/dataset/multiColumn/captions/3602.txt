Conservative Republicans are more doubtful than others about motives behind climate research findings. Conservative Republicans are particularly likely to think research findings from climate scientists are influenced by the desire of scientists to advance their own careers and by their personal political leanings. About half or more of conservative Republicans say each of these two factors influences research findings most of the time. Minorities in the other party/ideology groups say either of these influence research findings most of the time.
