There is a sharp partisan divide when it comes to Canadiansâ€™ opinions of the U.S. Followers of the incumbent Conservative Party of Canada (CPC), led by current Prime Minister Stephen Harper, have the most positive views of the U.S. (84%). Among those who support the Liberal Party, 71% give the U.S. a thumbs-up. But among backers of the social-democratic New Democratic Party (NDP), only 58% have a favorable view of America. Despite these differences, majorities of all political stripes in Canada still have a favorable view of the U.S.
