Germans in both areas say living standards in the former East have not yet caught up with those in the former West. Around three-quarters of people in the former East Germany (74%) and around two-thirds of those in the former West (66%) say the East still has not achieved the same living standards as the West, according to the Centerâ€™s recent survey, which was conducted among representative samples of adults in both areas as part of a larger study of Europe.
