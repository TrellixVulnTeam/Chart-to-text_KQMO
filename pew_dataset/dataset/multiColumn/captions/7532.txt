Public interest in the Iraq war remained high last week as the country marked the fourth anniversary of the conflict, and the House of Representatives passed a controversial war funding bill. At the same time the fallout from the firing of eight U.S. attorneys by the Justice Department failed to gain much traction with the public, in spite of intense media coverage of the story.
Beyond Iraq, the public divided its attention fairy evenly among the other top stories of the week – a missing Boy Scout found alive in North Carolina, news about the 2008 presidential campaign, medical care for wounded Iraq war veterans, and the U.S. attorney story. The third week into the U.S. attorney story, public interest increased only marginally, and the gap between coverage of the story and public attentiveness remained substantial. Only 20% of the public paid very close attention to news about the firings, and 8% said it was the story they followed most closely (unchanged from last week). Fully 18% of news coverage for the week was devoted to this story.
One in five Americans paid very close attention to news about the 2008 candidates and 17% closely followed news about Elizabeth Edwards’ recurrence of cancer. Roughly one-in-ten Americans (9%) said they followed the campaign more closely than any other major news story, and another 7% said they followed the Edwards news most closely.
