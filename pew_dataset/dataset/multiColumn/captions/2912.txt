Several recent high-profile incidents have illustrated some of the more severe experiences many women face online, from insults hurled at female journalists to the release of private nude photos of female celebrities. A new Pew Research Center survey reveals that while men are somewhat more likely to experience any form of online harassment, women report higher levels of emotional stress from their experiences and differ in their attitudes toward the underlying causes of such incidents.
There are also gender differences in views of online harassment as a public issue. Seven-in-ten women (70%) say they see online harassment as a major problem, compared with 54% of men. Younger women – those ages 18 to 29 – are especially likely to say this: More than eight-in-ten (83%) say it is a major problem, compared with 55% of men in the same age group.
Women are also much more likely than men to say people should be able to feel welcome and safe in online spaces (63% to 43%), while men are more likely than women to say it is important for people to be able to speak their minds freely online (56% to 36%). Similarly, half of women say that offensive content online is too often excused as not being a big deal, whereas 64% of men – and 73% of men ages 18 to 29 – say that many people take this type of content too seriously.
