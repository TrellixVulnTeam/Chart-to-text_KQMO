Two years ago, a 55% majority of Republicans said they were bothered a lot by the feeling that some corporations did not pay their fair share of taxes. Today, 44% of Republicans express this concern. Among Democrats, there has been virtually no change in the share saying they are bothered a lot by corporations not paying their fair share (73% then, 75% today).
Similarly, today, a smaller share of Republicans is bothered a lot by the feeling that some wealthy people do not pay their fair share of taxes (49% in 2015, 40% today). Again, there has been little change among Democrats in this view (71% then, 76% today).
