Republicans generally have a positive view of potential increases in tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. About six-in-ten (58%) say they would be good for the country, while just 26% say such tariff increases would be bad for the country. Democratic opinion is the opposite: Only 22% of Democrats think increasing steel and aluminum tariffs would be good for the U.S., while 63% say they would be bad for the country.
The partisan gap in views of tariffs is substantially wider among those who have heard “a lot” about the proposals than those who have not: Two-thirds (67%) of Republicans who have heard a lot about the proposed tariffs say they will be a good thing for the country, compared with just 8% of Democrats who have heard a lot about them.
