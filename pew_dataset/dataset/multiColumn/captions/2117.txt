English use is on the rise among young Hispanics. Still, about six-in-ten say they use Spanish, according to Pew Research Centerâ€™s 2016 National Survey of Latinos, which asked Hispanics to rate their own ability to speak and read Spanish and to speak and read English. Similar shares of young Hispanic adults are either English dominant (41%) or bilingual (40%), while 19% are Spanish dominant. By contrast, among Hispanics ages 36 and older, a lower share is English dominant (24%), with higher shares rating themselves bilingual (32%) and Spanish dominant (44%).
Many young Hispanic adults heard Spanish spoken at home while they were growing up, and today they speak Spanish to their children. About 86% of young Hispanic adults said Spanish was spoken in their home when they were growing up, similar to the share of older Hispanics who said the same (93%), according to the 2015 survey. Among young Hispanic adults who are parents, 86% say they speak Spanish to their children, with a similar share of older Hispanic parents (85%) saying the same.
