On dealing with North Korea, Americans preferred sanctions, while opinion in Asia-Pacific differed by country. A majority of Americans (61%) said increasing economic sanctions is better than deepening ties with North Korea, the spring 2017 global survey found. Republicans (70%) and older Americans (69%) were more likely to prefer sanctions than Democrats (61%) and younger people (49%). Attitudes diverged among Asia-Pacific countries on how best to deal with North Koreaâ€™s nuclear program. Half or more in Japan, South Korea and Australia backed stronger sanctions, while people in Vietnam and the Philippines leaned toward deepening ties with North Korea. (However, many of those surveyed in Indonesia and Vietnam did not offer an opinion.)
