White teens are more likely to work in the summer, as well as during the rest of the year, than teens of other racial and ethnic backgrounds. Last year, for example, the summer employment rate for 16- to 19-year-old whites was 37.5%, versus 28.9% for Hispanics, 25.8% for blacks and 20.1% for Asians. Almost 1.4 million more teens were employed in July 2018 than in April, a rough gauge of summer jobholding; nearly 1.1 million of those additional teen workers, or 78%, were white.
