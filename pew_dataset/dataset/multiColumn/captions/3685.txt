When panelists received invitations via text message and email, they completed the survey earlier in the field period than those who received only email. In fact, in the first 30 minutes after the survey invitations were sent, 15% of the text message and email group had responded to the survey vs. only 6% of the email-only group. This has important implications for survey researchers who need to collect data in a short amount of time.
