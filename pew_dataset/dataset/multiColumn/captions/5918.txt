Declaring “Our long national nightmare is over,” Ford famously granted Nixon a full pardon for Watergate, a decision that was immediately controversial. By a margin of 58% to 33%, the public thought Ford had done the “wrong thing” in a survey by Time magazine immediately following the pardon. This view persisted through the election of 1976, which Ford lost to Democrat Jimmy Carter.
Over time, the American public came to largely support Ford’s decision. A 2002 ABC poll found that about six-in-ten adults (59%) saw the pardon as the “right thing,” while just 32% said it was wrong.
