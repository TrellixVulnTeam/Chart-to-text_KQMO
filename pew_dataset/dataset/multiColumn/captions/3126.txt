Among the public overall, 62% say they are bothered “a lot” by the feeling that some corporations don’t pay their fair share of taxes, and 60% say the same about some wealthy people not paying their fair share.
About four-in-ten (43%) say they are bothered a great deal by the complexity of the system. But with the April 18 tax filing deadline approaching, only about a quarter (27%) say they are bothered a lot by the amount they pay in taxes. And just 20% say that about the feeling that the poor do not pay their fair share of taxes.
The latest national survey by Pew Research Center, conducted April 5-11, 2017 among 1,501 adults, finds an increase in the share saying that the tax system is unfair, largely because of a shift in opinion among Democrats.
