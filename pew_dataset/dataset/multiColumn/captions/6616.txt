Both the public and the media focused heavily on the January shootings in Tucson that left six dead and Rep. Gabrielle Giffords severely injured. Public interest stayed relatively high on this story, though coverage fell off more quickly as the media moved on to other developing stories – especially the growing unrest in the Middle East.
As the protests swelled in Cairo’s Tahrir Square – along with occasional outbreaks of violence – interest and coverage of the protests in Egypt ramped up quickly. After then-President Hosni Mubarak stepped down Feb. 11, the focus of coverage shifted to unrest elsewhere in the region. The percentage of the public saying they were following news about Egypt more closely than any other news fell off as well. Few closely followed voting last week on a new constitution.
