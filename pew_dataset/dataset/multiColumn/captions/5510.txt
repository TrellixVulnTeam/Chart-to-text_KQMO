That would seem to be at odds with recent survey results. A Washington Post/ABC News poll released this week, for instance, found that only 22% of the public said they were inclined to re-elect their representative in Congress. The all-time low (since 1990) was 17% in August 2011, just after that year’s debt-ceiling showdown. In the latest poll, two-thirds (68%) of people said they were “inclined to look around for someone else to vote for,” also a high for the Post/ABC poll.
