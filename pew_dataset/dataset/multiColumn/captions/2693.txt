Approval ratings for both Republican and Democratic congressional leaders remain negative on balance and are lower than they were in February. Today, 29% say they approve of the job Democratic leaders in Congress are doing, down from 37% in February.
Ratings for Republican leaders in Congress are even worse: just 22% say they approve of the job they are doing. Ratings for Republican leaders in Congress are down from a recent high point of 34%, reached in February at the start of the 115th Congress.
The recent drop in ratings for both Republican and Democratic congressional leaders is largely attributable to partisans’ increasingly negative assessments of their own party’s leaders.
