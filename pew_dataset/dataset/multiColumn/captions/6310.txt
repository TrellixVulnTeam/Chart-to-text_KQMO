Americans continued to follow news about the presidential campaign more closely than any other news last week, though they also closely followed news about the price of gasoline.
Nearly three-in-ten (28%) say news about the candidates for president was their top story, while 17% say they followed news about gas prices most closely. One-in-ten (10%) say they followed news about the U.S. economy more closely than any other story, according to the latest weekly News Interest Index survey, conducted May 24-27 among 1,012 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. Looking at a separate measure, comparable numbers say they very closely followed news about the economy (33%), the election (32%) and gas prices (32%).
News about the presidential election topped coverage, accounting for 19% of the newshole, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Centerâ€™s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). News about gas prices made up just 1% of coverage, while news about the economy overall accounted for 6%.
