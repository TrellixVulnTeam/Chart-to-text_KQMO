Even more dramatically, the ethnic composition of immigrants has changed. In 1960, the overwhelming share of immigrants were of European origin and few were born in Latin America and the Caribbean or Asia. By 2013, a census survey found half of immigrants were Latin American/Caribbean and 27% were Asian, while the European share of the immigrant population had fallen to a mere 13%.
