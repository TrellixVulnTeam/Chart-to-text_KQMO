Although the public is somewhat ambivalent on whether colleges and universities are responsible for preparing the American workforce, a majority (67%) say a four-year degree prepares someone at least somewhat well for a well-paying job in todayâ€™s economy. Democrats and Democratic leaners were more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners to say this (73% vs. 62%) in the 2016 survey, though Republican views on how colleges and universities affect the country have changed dramatically over the past two years.
