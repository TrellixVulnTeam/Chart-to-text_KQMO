Also, men are more likely than women to favor capital punishment (61% vs. 46%). Solid majorities of white evangelical Protestants (73%) and white mainline Protestants (61%) favor the death penalty, while Catholics (53%) and those without a religious affiliation (48%) are more divided on the issue. Partisanship also plays a role, with Republicans more than twice as likely as Democrats to support the death penalty (77% vs. 35%).
