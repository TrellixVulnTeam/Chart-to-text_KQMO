Americans are divided over whose responsibility it is to take care of displaced workers in the event of far-reaching job automation. Half of U.S. adults said that in the event that robots and computers are capable of doing many human jobs, it is the governmentâ€™s obligation to take care of displaced workers, even if it means raising taxes substantially, according to the 2017 survey. A nearly identical share (49%) said that obligation should fall on the individual, even if machines have already taken many human jobs.
