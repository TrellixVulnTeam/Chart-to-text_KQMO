While Hungarians and other Europeans may not agree on refugees and minorities, there is wide consensus on the importance of democratic values. Large majorities in Hungary say it is very important to live in a country where each democratic principle we asked about is adhered to. In 2015, a median across six EU nations showed similarly positive views.
Hungarians are even more supportive of certain democratic principles than other Europeans. In 2015, a median of 61% across six EU nations said that living in a country where the media can report the news without state censorship was very important. In our 2016 survey, 70% of Hungarians said the same. This high rating comes on the heels of years of criticism of the Orbán government’s handling of press freedom and low ratings for Orbán’s handling of the media (only 30% approve).
