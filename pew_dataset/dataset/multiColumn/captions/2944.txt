In France, Germany, South Korea and Mexico, eight-in-ten or more disapprove of pulling out of these trade agreements. Roughly half of Russians (49%) disapprove, compared with 28% who approve.
Climate change, and specifically the Paris climate accord, will also be on the agenda during the G20 summit. And although the Center’s survey was fielded before Trump’s announcement that the U.S. would leave the accord, most people in G20 member countries say they disapprove of his stated plan to do so.
The strongest disapproval is in Germany, where 93% disapprove of the plan to leave the climate accord. But there is also strong disapproval across Western Europe, East Asia and Latin America. In the U.S., 67% disapprove of Trump’s plan to leave the climate change agreement, though again, Democrats express more disapproval on this policy (88% disapprove) than Republicans (34%).
In India, the country with the fourth-largest carbon dioxide emissions behind China, the U.S. and the EU, 32% approve of Trump’s pulling out of climate accords, but 25% disapprove and most (43%) do not have an opinion.
