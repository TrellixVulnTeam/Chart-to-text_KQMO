A new Kaiser Family Foundation Health Tracking Poll, from which this chart of the week is taken, suggests that, despite the “invincible” tag, young adults are worried about their ability to foot medical bills. More than three-quarters of those ages 18 to 25 regard health insurance as something important for them to have, something they need and something that is worth the cost. About two-thirds of young adults — roughly the same number as the general population — worry about medical bills that might result from a serious illness or accident.
The survey, conducted June 4-9, did find a higher percentage of young adults than the overall population who believed they were healthy enough and didn’t really need insurance, but this still only constituted 24% of their age group compared to 11% of all adults.
