Digital advertising revenue continues to grow, but little of it benefits news organizations. Total digital advertising revenue has jumped 25% in 2017 across all types of digital outlets, not just news, according to eMarketer. This has been especially true of mobile advertising revenue, which totaled $61 billion in 2017, roughly equal to the total amount of digital advertising revenue just two years prior, in 2015 ($60 billion) – and which goes hand in hand with Americans’ increased use of mobile for news. However, news organizations seem to share little in this bonanza – 52% of all digital display advertising revenue goes to just two companies: Facebook and Google.
