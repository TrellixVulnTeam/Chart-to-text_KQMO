While there is support for making it easy for citizens to vote, the public is largely opposed to making voting required in national elections. Only two-in-ten (20%) would favor mandatory voting, while nearly eight-in-ten (78%) says citizens should be able to decide for themselves whether or not to vote in national elections.
