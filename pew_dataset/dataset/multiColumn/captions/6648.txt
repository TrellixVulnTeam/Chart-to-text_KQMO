About eight-in-ten (81%) say they heard a least a little last week about Somali pirates hijacking an American yacht and killing four hostages; 41% say they heard a lot about this, while 40% say they heard a little. Few (18%) had heard nothing at all. The media devoted 3% of the newshole to the pirate story.
About seven-in-ten (71%) say they heard at least a little about the possibility that the federal government could soon shut down if Republicans in Congress and the Obama Administration fail to agree on a budget. Nearly four-in-ten (37%) say they heard a lot about this, while 33% say they heard a little. That’s up from one week earlier when 21% said they had heard a lot about a possible shutdown and 35% said they had heard a little. If the government were to shut down, Americans are just as likely to blame the Obama administration as Republicans in Congress. ( See “More Side with Wisconsin Unions than Governor,” Feb. 28, 2011.)
Most of the public (74%) also says they heard at least a little about Toyota recalling about two million vehicles. About three-in-ten (29%) say they heard a lot about this, while 45% say they heard a little about the recall.
