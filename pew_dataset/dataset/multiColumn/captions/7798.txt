These are the principal findings of the Pew Research Centerâ€™s biennial survey of the national news audience, which documents the rapid emergence of the Internet as a news source, as well as a significant decline in regular viewership of broadcast television news. Fully one-in-three Americans now go online for news at least once a week, compared to 20% in 1998. And 15% say they receive daily reports from the Internet, up from 6% two years ago. At the same time, regular viewership of network news has fallen from 38% to 30% over this period, while local news viewership has fallen from 64% to 56%.
