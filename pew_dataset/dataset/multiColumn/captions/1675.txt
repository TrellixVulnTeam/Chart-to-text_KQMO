One other question, not included as part of the scale, asked survey respondents which of two statements best describes the scientific method: That it produces findings meant to be continually tested and updated over time, or that it identifies unchanging core principles and truths. Two-thirds of Americans (67%) say the scientific method is designed to be iterative, producing findings that are continually tested and updated, while 15% say the method produces unchanging core principles and truths, and 17% say they are not sure.
