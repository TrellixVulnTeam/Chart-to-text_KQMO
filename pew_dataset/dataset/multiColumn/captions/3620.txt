At a time of growing partisan polarization, Republicans and Democrats are deeply divided in their views of many issues and the opposing party. These differences extend to their opinions about the impact of many of the nation’s institutions, according to a Pew Research Center survey, and when it comes to the news media, this partisan gap is growing wider.
Majorities in both parties view the news media’s impact negatively, but this opinion is far more prevalent among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (85%) than among Democrats and Democratic leaners (59%). Just 9% of Republicans say the media have a positive effect on the way things are going in the U.S., compared with 33% of Democrats.
