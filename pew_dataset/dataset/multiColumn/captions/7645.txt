As described in a January 2006 Pew report,2 Republicans are far more likely than either Democrats or independents to see economic conditions as good or excellent; 56% of Republicans take that view compared with only 23% of Democrats and 28% of independents. These partisan differences in judgments about the economy are apparent across all income categories â€“ and are not simply a matter of Republicans being wealthier on average than other citizens. But, again, party affiliation makes a bigger difference if you feel well-off: Republicans who rate their own personal financial situation as excellent or good are even more likely than Democrats and independents to give a similar rating to the national economy.
