Paris Hiltonâ€™s troubles aside, the public remained focused on the war in Iraq last week. Fully 32% said they were following the situation in Iraq very closely and 25% said it was the story they followed most closely. Interest in Iraq remained substantial even though news coverage of Iraq declined significantly. Only 4% of the national news was devoted to events on the ground in Iraq and 2% to the Iraq policy debate. The policy debate had consistently been a top five story from the time George Bush announced the surge strategy in January through the end of May.
