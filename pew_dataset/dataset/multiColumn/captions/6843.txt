With so much public attention focused on the oil leak, only small percentages say they followed any of the other top stories most closely last week. Just 10% say this about the second ranked story, news about the economy. Fewer name the World Cup soccer tournament in South Africa (6%), the situation and events in Afghanistan (3%), drug-related violence in Mexico (2%) or ethnic violence in Kyrgyzstan (1%).
Similar patterns are seen in news coverage. The oil leak accounted for 44% of the newshole, far surpassing coverage of the economy (7%) and Afghanistan (5%). Drug-related violence in Mexico consumed less than 1% of all news coverage.
