As was the case in January, far more Americans say Trump’s economic policies have made U.S. economic conditions better (44%) than worse (23%), while 30% say they have not had much of an effect. These attitudes – like views of the economy itself – are divided by partisanship.
Republicans overwhelmingly say that Trump’s policies have made the economy better (79% say this). Just 13% of Democrats say Trump’s policies have made conditions better, while the remainder are about equally likely to say that his policies have not had much effect (42%) or have made economic conditions worse (41%).
