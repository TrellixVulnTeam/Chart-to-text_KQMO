Despite the growth in cell-only households, the magnitude of possible non-coverage bias remains relatively small for the majority of measures tested. Of 72 questions examined, 43 of them show differences of 0, 1 or 2 percentage points between the landline and dual frame weighted samples. Twenty-nine of the differences are 3 percentage points or more, all of which are statistically significant. Seventeen of the differences are 3 percentage points. Only one difference is as large as 7 points, while four others are 5 points and seven are 4 points.
The coverage problem in landline surveys is mostly caused by the cell-only households. But as noted by Blumberg and Luke1, people who have both a landline and cell phone, but are highly dependent on their cell phones for communication, may be underrepresented in surveys that include only the landline population and cell-only users. To disentangle these effects, we also computed estimates of the difference between landline samples and landline samples that include cell-only households (as opposed to all adults reached by cell phone). For the most part, the patterns of difference are the same as those seen in the comparison of landline and full dual frame surveys. But they are slightly smaller in magnitude: only four differences are four points or larger (compared with 12 for the landline vs. full dual frame comparison), and the average size of differences is 1.6 percentage points, vs. 2.1 percentage points for the full dual frame comparison.
