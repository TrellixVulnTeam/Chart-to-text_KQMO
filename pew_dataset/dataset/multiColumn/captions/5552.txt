Among Russian adults, a survey we conducted last year showed that about half (53%) think Muslim extremist groups pose a major threat to their country. Russian Muslims – especially those living in the North Caucasus – share their non-Muslim compatriots’ concerns about extremism. In a 2011-2012 Pew Research survey, nearly half of Russian Muslims said they were either very concerned (20%) or somewhat concerned (27%) about religious extremism in their country, including more than half of Muslims in the North Caucasus (33% very concerned, 25% somewhat concerned). The same survey revealed that the vast majority of Russia’s Muslims (86%) reject the use of violence against civilians in defense of Islam.
