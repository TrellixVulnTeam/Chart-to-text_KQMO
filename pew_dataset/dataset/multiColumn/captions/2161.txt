A separate survey by Pew Research Center finds that about four-in-ten Americans (43%) think it would a good thing for the country if a Democratic woman was elected president; 32% say this would be neither a good thing nor a bad thing, and 24% say it would be a bad thing for the country if a Democratic woman became president. When asked about the prospect of electing a Republican woman president, 32% say this would be a good thing, while 44% see it as neither good nor bad and 23% say it would be a bad thing for the country.
About seven-in-ten Democrats (69%) say a woman from their own party being elected president would be a good thing for the country. But when asked about the prospect of a Republican woman president, only 21% of Democrats say this would be a good thing; 44% say it would be neither good nor bad and 35% say it would be a bad thing.
Among Republicans, 47% say it would be a good thing to have a Republican woman as president, but a similar share (42%) see this as neither good nor bad. About one-in-ten (11%) say this would be a bad thing for the country. Republicans have far less positive views about the prospect of a Democratic woman being elected president: Just 10% say this would be a good thing while half (52%) say it would be a bad thing for the country.
