Roughly eight-in-ten Argentines (83%) say the countryâ€™s economic situation is bad. This share is lower than in 2002, when 98% said the economic situation was bad following an economic crisis. Currently, only 15% say the economic situation is good. (Our survey was conducted before the market shock that occurred in August.)
