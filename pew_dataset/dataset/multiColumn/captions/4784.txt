The Supreme Court’s decision in the case could impact how the public views the institution. Americans’ views of the high court are near their lowest point in at least the past few decades. As the court has handed down decisions on highly politicized cases in recent years, it has seen ebbs and flows in support from Democrats and Republicans.
For example, after the Supreme Court ruled to keep intact much of the health care law in summer 2012, 64% of Democrats said they viewed the court favorably, compared with just 38% of Republicans. But after the court’s session last June, which included a conservative victory on contraception in the Hobby Lobby case, the court’s favorability rose to 53% among Republicans and fell to 52% among Democrats. Overall, we found in that survey last July, about half of the public (52%) had a favorable opinion of the Supreme Court and 38% viewed it unfavorably.
