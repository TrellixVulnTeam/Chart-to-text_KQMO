As has been the case throughout the 2016 campaign, voters remain highly engaged by the presidential contest. A majority of registered voters (56%) say they have given “a lot” of thought to the candidates running for president.
At this point in the 2008 campaign, following the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary, fewer voters (50%) said they had thought a lot about the presidential candidates.
Interest in the campaign is unchanged since December, but has increased steadily since last March, when just 26% said they were giving a lot of thought to the presidential candidates.
