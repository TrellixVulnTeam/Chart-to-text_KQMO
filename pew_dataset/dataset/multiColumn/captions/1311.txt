Americans ages 50 and older are more likely to pay for local news than their younger counterparts. Around three-in-ten (29%) of those ages 65 and older and 15% of those 50 to 64 say they have paid a local news organization in the past year. By comparison, just 9% of those ages 30 to 49 and 7% of those 18 to 29 say they have done so.
White Americans and those with a college education are also more likely to pay for local news than their counterparts. For example, a little over two-in-ten Americans with a college degree (22%) say they have paid for local news in the past year, compared with 13% of those with some college education and just one-in-ten of those with a high school diploma or less.
