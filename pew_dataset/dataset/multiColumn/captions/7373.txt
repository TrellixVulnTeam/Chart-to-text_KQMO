Public assessments of the nationâ€™s economy have slipped considerably since last month. More than eight-in-ten Americans (81%) now say the economy is in fair or poor shape, and fewer than one-in-five Americans (17%) rate it as excellent or good, a nine point drop from the 26% who offered that view in January. Negative ratings of the economy have reached levels comparable to those seen during the recessions of the early 1990s and early years of the current decade.
