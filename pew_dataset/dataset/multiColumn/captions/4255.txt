As Canadians head to the polls for a historically close federal election, a new survey finds that people in Canada are generally satisfied with their countryâ€™s current relationship with the United States. More than half (54%) say that Canada should remain about as close to the U.S. as it has been in recent years, with another 27% saying Canada should be even closer and only 16% saying they should be less close.
