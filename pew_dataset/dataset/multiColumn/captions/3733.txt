A majority of voters (58%) who currently plan to support either Trump or Clinton say they don’t mind if people know who they support but that they don’t go out of their way to say it. A third say that they are “pretty outspoken” with others about their support, while far fewer (7%) say that they would rather other people not know that they support one of these candidates.
There are no significant differences between Clinton and Trump voters on their willingness to share who they support. Majorities of both groups (60% of Clinton supporters and 57% of Trump supporters) don’t mind if others know but don’t go out of their way to say so.
