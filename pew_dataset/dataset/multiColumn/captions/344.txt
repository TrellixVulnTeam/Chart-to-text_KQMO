Unlike in the U.S., people in other countries mostly say their own country has done a good job dealing with the outbreak. Around half of Americans (52%) say the country has done a bad job responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, while a similar share (47%) say the response has been good, according to a survey in the U.S. and 13 other countries this summer. People in most of the surveyed nations are far more likely to see their countryâ€™s response positively than negatively. In neighboring Canada, for example, 88% of adults say their country has done a good job, while just 11% say it has done a bad job. The balance of opinion is similar in Germany, the Netherlands and South Korea.
But public sentiment is not positive everywhere. In the United Kingdom, 54% of adults say their country has done a bad job handling COVID-19, while 46% say it has done a good job. People in Spain are also fairly closely divided: A little over half (54%) say the country has done a good job responding to COVID-19, while 47% say the response has been bad.
