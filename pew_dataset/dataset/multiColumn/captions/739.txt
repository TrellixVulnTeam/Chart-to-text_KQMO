A majority of Americans (61%) say the federal government is mostly (40%) or entirely (21%) responsible in making sure there are enough COVID-19 tests available to the public. About four-in-ten (37%) say this responsibility at least mostly falls on the state government.
Younger adults are more likely than those who are older to say the federal government should take the lead in making testing for COVID-19 widely available. Seven-in-ten adults ages 18 to 29 say the federal government should be responsible for making COVID-19 testing available, the highest share in any age group.
Republicans are ideologically divided in views of whether the states or federal government should be responsible for making sure there are enough COVID-19 tests. Nearly two-thirds of conservative Republicans (65%) say this is the responsibility of a state government; a majority of moderate and liberal Republicans (55%) say it is the federal governmentâ€™s responsibility. Among Democrats, a larger majority of liberals (85%) than conservatives and moderates (73%) say the responsibility for ensuring an adequate supply of COVID-19 tests lies with the federal government.
