In the news last week, no single story captured the interest of the American public. The war in Iraq was the most closely followed news story — 26% of the public followed news of the war very closely and 20% listed this as their most closely followed story.
The shooting at a Cleveland, Ohio high school attracted only moderate interest. The incident, which resulted in the death of the shooter but no other fatalities, was followed very closely by 22% of the public and 17% listed this as their most closely followed story. Interest in this shooting was much lower than previous school shootings many of which had been followed very closely by nearly 50% of the public. The national news media devoted 4% of its overall coverage to the shootings, the bulk of which was on network and cable television news.
The media focused heavily on the 2008 presidential campaign— devoting 15% of its coverage to campaign-related news. Public interest in the campaign fell off significantly last week with only 13% of the public paying very close attention to campaign news (8% listed the campaign as their most closely followed story).
