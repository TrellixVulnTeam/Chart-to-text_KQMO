Black Americans are less concerned about made-up news than other national issues. When asked what they think about “made-up news and information,” about four-in-ten black adults (42%) say it is a very big problem, compared with about half of whites (51%). They also rank it much lower among a list of potential challenges. Among whites, made-up news draws more concern than seven of the 11 issues asked about. But among blacks, most of these issues are seen as more important than made-up news. Hispanics also rate most other problems as more important than made-up news.
