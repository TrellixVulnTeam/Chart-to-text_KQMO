These are among the major findings from a Pew Research Center survey conducted among 6,204 respondents in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia and Turkey from Feb. 27 to April 25, 2017.
Middle Eastern publics see both the U.S. and Russia playing more important roles in the region today than they did 10 years ago.
At least half in all of the nations surveyed say Russia is more influential now compared with a decade ago. Lebanon is particularly likely to say Russiaâ€™s role has grown, with Shia (81%) and Sunni Muslims (77%) sharing this view.
