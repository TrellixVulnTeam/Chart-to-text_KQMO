There is a significant ideological divide on this question among Democrats. Three-quarters of liberal Democrats and Democratic leaners say the pre-emptive use of military force can rarely or never be justified. By contrast, conservative and moderate Democrats and Democratic leaners are more evenly divided: 52% say it can rarely or never be justified, while 46% say it can sometimes or often be justified.
There are modest differences on this question across many demographic groups, including age and gender. However, when it comes to levels of educational attainment, postgraduates express distinct views. Overall, 62% of postgraduates say that using military force against countries that may seriously threaten but have not attacked the U.S. can rarely or never be justified; fewer (37%) say it can sometimes or often be justified. By contrast, those with lower levels of education are more likely to say pre-emptive force can sometimes or often be justified: About half of those with a college degree or less education say this.
