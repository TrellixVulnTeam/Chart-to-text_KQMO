The absence of such a frame has led to lingering concerns about whether the fraction of the population covered by nonprobability approaches can be made to look representative of the entire population. For roughly 15 years, independent studies suggested that the answer to that question was generally “no” if the goal was to make accurate population estimates.1 Over time, though, researchers and sample vendors have developed technologies and statistical techniques aimed at improving the representativeness of online nonprobability surveys. Several recent case studies suggest a future (some would argue a present) in which researchers need not have an expensive, probability-based sample to make accurate population estimates.
Nearly all of the questions (52) were also asked on waves of the Center’s probability-based American Trends Panel (ATP), which is conducted predominantly online but features mail response for adults who do not have internet access. The samples were evaluated using a range of metrics, including estimated bias on 20 full sample survey estimates for which high quality government benchmarks are available, estimated bias for major demographic subgroup estimates, and predictive accuracy of four different regression models. Among the most important findings of this study are the following:
There is also evidence, though less consistent, that online nonprobability samples tilt more toward certain lifestyles. Most of the samples have disproportionately high shares of adults who do not have children, live alone, collect unemployment benefits and are low-income. In some respects, this squares with a stereotype one might imagine for people who find time to participate in online survey panels, perhaps akin to a part-time job. On other dimensions, however, the online nonprobabilty estimates are either quite accurate (e.g., have a driver’s license or length of time at current residence) or the biases are not in a consistent direction across the samples (e.g., daily smoking).
