When it comes to public opinion, Americans generally have a favorable view of unions and believe that the long-term decline in their membership has been more of a bad thing than a good thing.
A 55% majority of U.S. adults said earlier this year that they view labor unions favorably, compared with a third who viewed them unfavorably. These views have fluctuated over the past two decades, but are now more positive than they were during the Great Recession. In the same survey, around half of Americans (51%) said the reduction in union representation over the past 20 years has been mostly bad for working people, while around a third (35%) said it has been mostly good.
