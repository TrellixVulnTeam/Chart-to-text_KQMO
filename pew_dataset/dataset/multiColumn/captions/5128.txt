Pew Research Center does not have polling data on press treatment, but we did recently poll the Turkish public on the mediaâ€™s influence on the nation. Only 32% of Turks said that the media is having a good influence on the way things are going in Turkey. Although no institution earned a large majority of support, the media ranked lower than the military (55%), the police (55%), the national government (51%) and then Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan (48%). Turkish views of the media were also slightly lower than public opinion of the court system (37%) and religious leaders (37%).
