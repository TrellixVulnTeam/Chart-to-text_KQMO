More than one-in-five (22%) say they very closely followed developments in Iran in the aftermath of a disputed presidential election. But that was down from one week earlier, when three-in-ten (31%) said they were following developments very closely as the government cracked down on protesters. This was the story followed most closely by 9%. Coverage of developments in Iran dropped to 4% in the most recent week from 19% the week before.
Close to one-in-five (19%) say they very closely followed the U.S. Supreme Court decision that found a group of New Haven firefighters had been illegally denied promotion because of their race. The case has taken on additional national prominence because President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Sonia Sotomayor, was part of the appeals court panel whose judgment was overturned. For 5%, this was the story they followed more closely than any other. The court ruling accounted for 4% of the newshole.
A similar share (18%) says they very closely followed the sentencing of Bernard Madoff to 150 years in prison for his role in a multi-billion dollar investment fraud; 4% say this was the story they followed most closely. The share following Madoff’s sentencing very closely reflects a drop in interest from earlier stories dealing with revelations about the extent of his fraud in December (30% very closely) and his guilty plea in March (27% very closely). The media devoted 5% of coverage to Madoff’s sentencing.
