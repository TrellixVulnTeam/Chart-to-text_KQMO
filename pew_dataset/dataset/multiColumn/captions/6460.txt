No single story stands out in the most recent weekly News Interest Index survey, conducted Oct. 20-23, 2011, among 1,009 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. While 15% say the condition of the economy was their top story, about as many cite Gadhafi’s death (13%), the release of wild animals in Ohio (13%) or news about the 2012 presidential candidates (13%) as the news they followed most closely.
Another 12% say their top story was President Obama’s announcement that he will withdraw all U.S. forces from Iraq by the end of 2011; 9% say they followed news about the anti-Wall Street protests in New York and other cities most closely.
Though it came late in the week, Gadhafi’s violent death topped news coverage, along with news about the 2012 presidential election. Each made up 17% of the newshole, according to a separate analysis by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). News about the economy in general accounted for 12% of coverage, not including 4% devoted specifically to the Occupy Wall Street protests.
