Opinions about the U.S. response are especially negative in South Korea, Denmark, Germany and Belgium. In each of these countries, around nine-in-ten adults say the U.S. response to COVID-19 has been bad, including roughly two-thirds in South Korea (66%) and Belgium (64%) who say it has been very bad.
People outside the U.S. rate America’s response to COVID-19 more negatively than the response of their own country, the World Health Organization, the European Union and – in most cases – China. In all 13 countries surveyed this summer, people see the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak as worse than the response of their own country, the WHO and the EU. And in all but one country, Japan, people see America’s response more negatively than that of China. (In Japan, 15% of adults say the U.S. has done a good job, while 16% say the same about China.)
