Unfavorable opinion of China in the U.S. has reached its highest point since Pew Research Center began polling on this topic in 2005. About two-thirds (66%) of U.S. adults said in a March survey they had a negative view of the country – up nearly 20 percentage points since the beginning of the Trump administration. Roughly seven-in-ten Americans (71%) also say they do not have confidence in Chinese President Xi Jinping to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs – a high since the Center first asked the question in 2014.
