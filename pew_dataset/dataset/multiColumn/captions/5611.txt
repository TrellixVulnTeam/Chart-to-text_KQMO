While it didn’t ask specifically about parental leave, the Pew Research Center’s new survey on women and men in the workplace did find that about a third of both men and women said the ability to take time off for family needs was “extremely important” to them in a job. An analysis of global data compiled by the OECD shows that, compared with 37 other nations, the U.S. is an outlier when it comes to paid leave — it is the only nation that does not offer federal paid leave for new parents. (Although many large companies in the U.S. provide some paid leave to employees.)
