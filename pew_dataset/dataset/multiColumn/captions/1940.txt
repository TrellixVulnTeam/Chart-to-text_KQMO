Income and education also influence how people look for a new church. In some cases, church “shoppers” with higher incomes are more likely than less-affluent adults to research a potential new religious congregation. For instance, among the roughly half of Americans who have looked for a new congregation, 44% of those with family incomes of $75,000 or more read about the congregation online, compared with 37% of those with incomes between $30,000 and $74,999, and about three-in-ten (28%) with incomes below $30,000. People with higher incomes also are more likely to visit houses of worship to attend services and to talk to friends or colleagues before choosing a new congregation.
