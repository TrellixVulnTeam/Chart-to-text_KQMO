One potential reason the public may place the blame for unfair coverage on news organizations more than journalists is that Americans generally believe individual journalists are capable of distancing their own views from their reporting. Six-in-ten U.S. adults say it is possible for journalists to fully set aside their own views and opinions when reporting on an issue or event, much higher than the 39% who say they cannot do this. And while Democrats are somewhat more likely than Republicans to think journalists are able to distance their views from their reporting, at least half in both parties say this (65% vs. 53%).
