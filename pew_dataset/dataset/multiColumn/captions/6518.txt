The public was far less attentive to the other top stories of the week. Just 3% each say that the candidates for the 2012 presidential elections, the food shortage in Somalia or a partial shutdown of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was their most closely followed story. The 2012 elections and the famine in Somalia each received 2% of news coverage, while the FAA shutdown accounted for 6% of the newshole. Congress approved a measure late Friday allowing the FAA to resume operations and bring furloughed employees back to work. Close to two-in-ten (17%) tracked this news very closely.
One-in-ten (10%) reported following the ongoing violence in Syria very closely, while just 1% say this was their top story of the week. The media devoted 5% of all coverage to the conflict, making it the fourth most heavily covered story of the week.
About one-in-ten (12%) followed news about the famine in Somalia caused by severe drought and an ongoing civil conflict. Interest levels are comparable to Sept. 1992 (11% very closely), when Somalia struggled with famine and a civil war. Public interest in the situation increased dramatically in January 1993 (52% very closely) after the U.S. sent troops to restore order and alleviate the famine.
