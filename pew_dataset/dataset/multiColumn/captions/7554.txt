The Scooter Libby trial – a complex, inside-the-Beltway story – has yet to spark widespread interest among the public. Stories about the trial accounted for 3-4% of the newshole during the last two weeks of January. The Libby trial has been the top news story for just 1% of the public, and fewer than 10% have been following it very closely. The public was much more intrigued with the circumstances surrounding the outing of CIA operative Valerie Plame back in July 2005, when Karl Rove was still a central character.
