Currently, there are modest differences in outlook by levels of educational attainment. Those with some college experience are somewhat less likely to say they have a lot of confidence in the future of the U.S. than are both those with more and less education. The shares who say they have a lot of confidence are down significantly since 2015 among postgraduates (13 points), college graduates (8 points) and those with some college experience (7 points). There has been no significant shift in outlook among those with no more than a high school diploma.
