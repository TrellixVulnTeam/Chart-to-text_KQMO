Of course, today’s announcement could have a major impact on public opinion – it’s likely that FJP supporters will react negatively to the ultimatum – but it is clear that the military comes into this crisis with a stronger public image than many of the country’s key political players. For example, the March survey found mixed views regarding the nation’s largest political parties. About half (52%) had a favorable opinion of the FJP, while 44% expressed a negative view. Meanwhile, ratings for both the NSF (45% favorable, 52% unfavorable) and al-Nour (40% favorable, 52% unfavorable) were on balance negative.
