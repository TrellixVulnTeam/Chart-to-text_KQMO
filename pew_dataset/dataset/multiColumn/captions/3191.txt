For example, half of all frequently angry and frustrated officers say that most people respect the police, a view shared by roughly eight-in-ten officers (78%) who are not frequently angry or frustrated. Officers who say they frequently feel frustrated by their job, but not angry, fall squarely in the middle.
In addition, frequently angry and frustrated officers are roughly twice as likely as those who are not frequently angry or frustrated to agree that police have reason to be distrustful of most citizens (46% vs. 21%). About eight-in-ten angry and frustrated officers (77%) agree that they have become more callous toward people since taking the job. This compares with 42% of officers who say they are not frequently angry or frustrated.
