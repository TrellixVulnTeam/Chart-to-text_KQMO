The analysis of national standardized testing scores shows that about 51% of 8th grade ELL students are behind whites in reading and math, meaning that the scores for one out of every two will have to improve for the group to achieve parity. In the 4th grade, 35% of ELL students are behind in math and 47% are behind in reading when compared with their white counterparts. The report also compares scores for ELL students to those of black and Hispanics students and finds smaller but still substantial gaps.
