A 2013 Pew Research Center survey of Hispanic adults finds that about six-in-ten Dominican adults (59%) identify themselves as Catholic. Roughly two-in-ten (21%) Dominicans are Protestant, and among all Dominicans, 6% are mainline Protestants and 16% are evangelical Protestants. Some 16% of Dominican adults are religiously unaffiliated. In contrast, among all Hispanics 55% identify as Catholic, 22% identify as Protestant, and about two-in-ten (18%) are unaffiliated.
