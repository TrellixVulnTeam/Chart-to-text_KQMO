The public clearly has doubts that President Maduro is the right man to get Venezuela back on course. A majority (57%) in the poll says the president has a bad influence on the country’s direction, compared with 40% who say he has a good influence. By a 55% to 44% margin, Venezuelans also say they are dissatisfied with the overall political system.
Fortunately for Maduro, the political opposition seems ill-positioned to take advantage of the public’s frustrations. Barely a year after opposition candidate Henrique Capriles fell short in his effort to win the presidency from Maduro by less than one percent, most Venezuelans (52%) say the opposition has a bad influence on the country’s direction – nearly on par with Maduro’s negative rating.
