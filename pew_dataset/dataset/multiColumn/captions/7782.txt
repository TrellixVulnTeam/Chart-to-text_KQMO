President Bush’s overall job approval rating has risen only slightly in recent days, even as increasing numbers believe that the war in Iraq has been won. The president’s current rating is 72%, statistically unchanged from 74% immediately after the fall of Baghdad, but notably higher than his prewar approval rating of 55%. But his approval mark has not yet come close to matching President George H.W. Bush’s peak approval score of 89% after the successful conclusion of the Persian Gulf War in 1991.
