Overall, 41% favored the increased use of fracking to extract oil and natural gas from underground rock formations while 47% are opposed, according to last November’s poll. In March 2013, there was more support (48%) than opposition (38%) to increased use of the drilling technique. Republicans support increased fracking far more than Democrats, by a 62% to 29% margin. There was a particularly dramatic change of views in the Midwest where increased use of fracking is now opposed by a 47% to 39% margin compared with the majority who favored its use in 2013.
In broad terms, developing alternative energy is viewed (by 60% to 30%) as a more important priority than expanding the exploration and production of oil, coal and natural gas, according to a December 2014 survey. Yet when asked about specific policies to address the energy supply, a majority of Americans continue to support allowing more offshore oil and gas drilling in U.S. waters (56%) and more mining and drilling on federally owned land (58%) — opinions largely unchanged from previous years. About eight-in-ten (81%) Americans support requirements for better fuel efficiency for cars and trucks.
