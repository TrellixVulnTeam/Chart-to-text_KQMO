There has been an overall gain of 6.4 million more non-farm payroll jobs last month than in January 2009, which represents a 4.8% increase. All of that growth came from the private sector, while the public sector shrunk: Private payrolls have added 7 million jobs over Obamaâ€™s presidency, while government payrolls (federal, state and local) have contracted by a combined 634,000 jobs. The service sector has generated many of the new jobs, particularly in health care, temporary help, and the bar, restaurant and food service business.
