Obama’s job rating among independents has rebounded sharply from a low point in January. Currently, 45% of independents approve of Obama’s job performance while 44% disapprove. Last month, just 37% approved and 56% disapproved. Obama also has improved his standing with independent voters in a general election matchup with Mitt Romney.
