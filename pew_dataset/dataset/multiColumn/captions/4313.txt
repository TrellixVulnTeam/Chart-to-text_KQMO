Survey items were chosen for inclusion if they were asked of the total sample and not only the Web-mode panelists. Items were excluded if they had complex skip patterns based on previous wavesâ€™ responses. A few items were excluded if they, or an item very similar to them, were already asked in a previous wave. The items chosen for the analysis of differences among subgroups in the population are frequently used measures across the major research domains at Pew Research Center.
For this analysis two weights were created for each wave of data collection. The first weights the total sample, including the Web and mail panelists, to demographic targets of all U.S. adults living in households. The second weights only the Web-mode portion of the panel to these same total population targets. Additional information about the weighting, including the sources of the targets, can be found in the methods section at the end of this report.
