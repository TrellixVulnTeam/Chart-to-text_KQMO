Both black and Hispanic respondents were more likely than whites to say they feel they need to stay tuned in to news about the coronavirus outbreak. Roughly four-in-ten black adults said this (39%), as did 36% of Hispanics. Around a quarter of white adults (23%) said the same. Still, majorities in all three groups said they need to take breaks from this news from time to time (76% of white, 63% of Hispanic and 60% of black adults).
