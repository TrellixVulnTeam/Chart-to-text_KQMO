The public’s interest in developments in Egypt remained high last week as the media focused increasingly on domestic debates over how to deal with the fiscal troubles facing many states and how to bring down the federal deficit.
About a third of the public (32%) says they followed news about the situation in Egypt more closely than any other news story last week. That is down from 48% one week earlier, but still ranks – by a wide margin – as the public’s top story for the week, according to the latest News Interest Index survey conducted Feb. 17-20 among 1,001 adults. And, as unrest grew in nations like Libya and Bahrain, another 3% say they followed news about anti-government protests elsewhere in the region most closely.
But the public also kept a close watch on several economic story lines. Fully 14% say news about the economy was their top story of the week. Another 14% say they most closely followed news about state and local budget problems and 8% say they followed discussions in Washington about how to address the federal budget deficit this closely.
Together, the economic themes topped coverage last week, making up a total of 35% of the newshole examined by the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ). Coverage of state budget problems, most notably the noisy confrontations in Wisconsin over the governor’s push to curtail collective bargaining rights for public employees, accounted for 16%, while the debate in Washington over the federal budget accounted for 14%. More general news about the economy totaled 5% of coverage.
