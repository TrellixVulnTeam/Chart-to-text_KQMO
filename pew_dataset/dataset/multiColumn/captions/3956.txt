Catholicsâ€™ views on these and similar questions may reflect the fact that American Catholics themselves are experiencing family life in all its modern complexity. One-quarter of Catholics say they have been divorced, including one-in-ten who are now remarried. And fully 44% of U.S. Catholics say they have lived together with a romantic partner outside of marriage at some point in their lives, including 9% who are currently cohabiting.
