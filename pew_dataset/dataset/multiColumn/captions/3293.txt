Just 39% approve of the job Trump has done in explaining his plans and policies, while 41% approve of his high-level appointments, according to a Pew Research Center national survey, conducted Jan. 4-9 among 1,502 adults. These opinions have changed little since December.
In January 2009, just before Barack Obamaâ€™s inauguration, 70% approved of the job he had done explaining his plans and policies for the future and 66% said they approved of his Cabinet selections.
