When it comes to international perceptions of Russia, a majority of Russians say their country should be more respected around the world. Roughly six-in-ten (61%) say Russia does not get enough respect, with only about half that (32%) saying Russia is as respected around the world as it should be. These sentiments are largely unchanged since 2017, but since 2012, feelings that Russia is as respected as it should be have doubled.
