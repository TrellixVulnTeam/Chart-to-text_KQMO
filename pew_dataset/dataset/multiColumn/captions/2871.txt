Compared with 2015, Republicans are far more likely to say that on the issues that matter to them, their side has been winning more than it has been losing.
Still, while Republicans now control the White House and both houses of Congress, just 42% say their side has been winning more often than it has been losing, while 46% say the opposite, according to separate survey conducted June 8-18 among 2,504 adults. Two years ago, fully 79% said their side was losing more often, compared with 14% who said it was winning more.
Democratsâ€™ views are now almost identical to those of Republicans in 2015. By 79% to 15%, Democrats say their side has been losing more often than it has been winning. Two years ago, 52% of Democrats said their wide had been losing more often, while 40% said it had been winning more often.
