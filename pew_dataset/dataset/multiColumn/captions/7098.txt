Americans divided their attention among several major stories last week as President Obama reached out to the Muslim world in a major speech, a jetliner crashed into the Atlantic Ocean and General Motors filed for bankruptcy protection. At the same time, they continued to keep a close watch on news about the troubles facing the U.S. economy.
Meanwhile, the latest weekly News Interest Index survey, conducted June 5-8 by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, shows that interest in news about the U.S. economy remained strong across most groups. About two-in ten (22%) say they followed economic news more closely than other major stories.
A comparable share (21%) say they followed news about the deadly plane crash most closely, while 17% say the same about Obamaâ€™s speech to the Muslim world on June 4. A slightly smaller share (13%) say they followed news about the GM bankruptcy filing more closely than other major stories, while 7% say they followed news about the NBA final series most closely, and 5% say they followed news about the killing of a Kansas doctor who performed abortions that closely.
