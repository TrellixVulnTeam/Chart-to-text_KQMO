More than half of immigrants from South and East Asian countries (52.1%) had a bachelorâ€™s degree or more in 2016, which is in part explained by Asian countries being the largest source of foreign college graduates who stay to work in the United States. Asian immigrants also make up a majority of H-1B visa holders and foreign students. Latin American immigrants, by contrast, tend to have lower levels of education. The vast majority of Mexican immigrants (81.2%) and Central American immigrants (74.6%) had a high school degree or less, the lowest educational attainment level of any origin region.
