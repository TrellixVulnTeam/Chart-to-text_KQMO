Near the end of the Great Recession, about one-in-five Hispanics ages 18 and 19 were “disconnected youth” – neither working nor going to school. But, helped by the economic recovery, the share of these young Hispanic adults not working or enrolled in school dropped from 21% in 2009 to a historic low of 16% by 2014, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of federal government data.
Only among Hispanics has the share of detached youth dropped below recession-era levels. By comparison, 19% of blacks of the same age were neither working nor in school in 2014, a level that has not changed much over the past decade, even during the recession. Among whites of this age, the share of detached young adults (12%) remained above pre-recession levels.
Overall, 14% of adults in the U.S. ages 18 and 19 are neither working nor in school, according to data from the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics. This share has held steady over the past decade. (Some young people are not included in this analysis: those in the military and prison. The data source, the Current Population Survey, excludes people in institutions like those.)
