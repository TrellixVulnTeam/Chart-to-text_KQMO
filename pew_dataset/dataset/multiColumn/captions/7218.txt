Pew found voters gave Obama high marks for how he ran his campaign. Fully 75% of voters gave his campaign an A or B grade, the highest percentage any candidate has received since Pew began asking voters to grade presidential campaigns in 1988. In fact, on average, a winning candidate has received an A or B grade from about 55% of voters the past five presidential cycles.
