A new Pew Research Center survey finds roughly eight-in-ten South Koreans (78%) have a favorable opinion of the U.S. While this figure is basically unchanged since Obama first took office in 2009, it is a significant improvement from the early years of the George W. Bush era. In the months following the invasion of Iraq in 2003, positive views towards America dropped to 46%. However, before Bush left office in 2008, they had climbed back to 70%, and have remained high ever since.
