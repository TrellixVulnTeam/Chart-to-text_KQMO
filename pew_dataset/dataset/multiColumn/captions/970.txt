Those who favor right-wing populist parties in Europe express less support for freedom of religion â€“ with two exceptions. In most cases, Europeans who support right-wing populist parties are less supportive of freedom of religion than those who do not hold favorable views of these parties. For example, only 30% of those who favor the Sweden Democrats party say it is very important that people can practice their religion freely, while 62% of those with an unfavorable view of Sweden Democrats say the same. However, those who hold favorable views of right-wing populist parties in Poland and Spain are more likely to support freedom of religion than those who have unfavorable views of these parties.
