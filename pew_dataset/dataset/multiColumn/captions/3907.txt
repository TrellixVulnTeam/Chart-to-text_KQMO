The challenges of polling Asian Americans are likely to persist in the foreseeable future, though some trends may make this task easier. Among U.S. adults, Asians are projected to be the third-fastest-growing racial/ethnic group behind Hispanics and multiracial adults. By 2030, Asians will make up 6.9% of U.S. adults, and by 2060, they will make up 9.4% of the adult population.
