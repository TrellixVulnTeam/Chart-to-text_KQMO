As Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress battle over President Barack Obamaâ€™s economic stimulus package, the latest survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press finds the Democratic Party with a vast favorability advantage over the GOP. More than six-in-ten Americans (62%) say they have a positive opinion of the Democratic Party, compared with 40% who say they have a favorable opinion of the Republican Party.
The survey, conducted Jan. 7-11 among 1,503 adults on cell phones and landlines, finds that the Democratic Party is currently seen more favorably than the Republican Party among nearly every demographic group. Even among white evangelical Protestants, who are some of the most loyal supporters of the Republican Party, opinions about the two parties are about even. Fully half of white evangelicals have a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party and about the same number (48%) say they have a positive opinion of the GOP.
A solid majority of Republicans continues to give their own party high marks; nearly three-quarters (74%) say they have a positive view of the Republican Party. Yet, this is considerably smaller than the share of Democrats who express favorable opinions of the Democratic Party (90%). Nearly six-in-ten independents (58%) express positive opinions of the Democratic Party, compared with 38% who say they have a favorable impression of the Republican Party.
