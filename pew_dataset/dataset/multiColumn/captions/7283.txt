Interest in the war in Iraq was higher last week than it has been in several months. A third of the public followed news about Iraq very closely, up from 24% the previous week, and 13% listed this as their most closely followed news story. Interest in the situation in Afghanistan was also up significantly. More than one-in-four Americans (27%) followed news about the military effort in Afghanistan very closely, and another 33% paid fairly close attention. This is up from 19% who followed the story very closely the previous week. Still, only 5% listed Afghanistan as their most closely followed story.
