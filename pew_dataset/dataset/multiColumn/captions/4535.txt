The president’s trip to India may have helped his image there. About three-in-four Indians express confidence in Obama, up from 48% in 2014. It’s been a year of high-profile visits in the U.S.-India relationship. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the U.S. last September, and Obama traveled to India in January. The trip seems to have increased Indians’ familiarity with the American president – the share of the public with no opinion about Obama dropped from 37% last year to 17% today.
