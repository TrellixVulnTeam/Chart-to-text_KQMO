The public divided its attention among the top stories last week, though Americans say they followed news about the economy – and the fate of General Motors – most closely.
Two-in-ten say they followed news about the condition of the U.S. economy most closely among the leading stories. More than four-in-ten (43%) say they followed economic news very closely, comparable to the share following the economy very closely in recent weeks. According to PEJ, coverage of the economic crisis took up 9% of the newshole.
Close to two-in-ten (18%) say they followed reports about General Motors’ plans to file bankruptcy most closely. A third say they followed those stories very closely, while another 40% followed them fairly closely. Those numbers are similar to the share following American carmakers’ troubles in recent surveys. Stories about GM’s plans – the company filed for Chapter 11 on June 1 – and developments at Chrysler accounted for 7% of the newshole.
