Despite the improving economy, most Americans continue to say that they are falling behind the cost of living.
Overall, 55% said in the Jan. 7-11 survey that their family’s income is falling behind the cost of living, while 37% say it’s staying about even; only 6% think their family income is going up faster than the cost of living. Views on this question have shown no improvement over the course of the last year; in August 2014, 56% said they felt they were falling behind the cost of living. Today, about two-thirds (65%) of those with family incomes of less than $30,000 a year say they are falling behind.
