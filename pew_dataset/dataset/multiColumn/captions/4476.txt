The U.S. receives higher favorable ratings in Africa than in any other region. Our 2015 survey found mostly positive ratings for the U.S. around the globe, but they were especially high in Africa – across the nine nations surveyed in the region, a median of 79% expressed a favorable opinion of the U.S., while just 10% had an unfavorable view.
Key elements of American soft power are embraced in Africa. As our 2013 survey highlighted, publics in the region tend to express positive attitudes toward American science and technology, ways of doing business, ideas about democracy, and popular culture. Moreover, a median of 56% said it was good that American ideas and customs were spreading to their country – a higher percentage than in the other regions where we asked this question in 2012 and 2013.
