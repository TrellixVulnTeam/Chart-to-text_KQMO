An overwhelming majority (69%) say that Islam plays a large role in the political life of Turkey, with only 26% saying it plays a small role. Since 2005, six-in-ten or more have said Islam is a major force in Turkish politics. However, in 2002, prior to Erdoganâ€™s election as prime minister, the public was split: 45% said Islam played a large role, while 43% said a small role.
