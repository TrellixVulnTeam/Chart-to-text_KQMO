Three-in-ten Americans (30%) say research on GM foods is often based on the best available evidence. An equal share of U.S. adults say desires of scientists to help their industries influence research findings on GM foods most of the time; half (50%) of the public says this occurs some of the time.
A 2016 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine suggests there is consensus among scientific experts that GM foods are safe. However, most Americans perceive considerable disagreement in the scientific community. Only a minority of Americans say that almost all (14%) or more than half (28%) of scientists agree that GM foods are safe to eat.
