Beyond the raw dollar figures, an arguably more useful way to look at the national debt is as a percentage of gross domestic product. Based on the latest GDP estimate the debt currently stands at just over 100% of gross domestic product, its highest level since just after World War II. (It was 55.6% of GDP at the end of fiscal 2001, according to a useful primer prepared by the Congressional Research Service.) That gives the United States one of the higher debt-to-GDP ratios among the 30 developed economies tracked by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, though not the highest: That title goes to Japan, whose public debt is more than twice its GDP.
