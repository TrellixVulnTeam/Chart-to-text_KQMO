The latest evidence for that comes from Minneapolis-based investment bank Piper Jaffray. Earlier this spring, the firm, which regularly surveys teens’ spending patterns, brand preferences, media and entertainment habits and other information of interest to investors, asked 4,800 teens nationwide whether they shopped online; not surprisingly, more than three-quarters said they did. But when Piper asked teens whether they preferred shopping online or in stores, 78% of girls and 75% of boys said they’d rather go to actual stores.
