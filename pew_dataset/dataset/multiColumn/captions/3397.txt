As was the case during the campaign, perceptions of Trump’s ideological views are divided, though only modestly along partisan lines. Overall, 46% characterize Trump’s views as all or mostly conservative, while 41% think of his views as a mix of conservative and liberal (9% say his views are all or mostly liberal).
But among Republicans, beliefs about Trump’s views tend to mirror their own: 57% of conservative Republicans and leaners say Trump’s views are all or mostly conservative, while moderate Republicans are more likely to think of him as having a mix of conservative and liberal views (34% say his views are conservative, 52% say they are a mix).
