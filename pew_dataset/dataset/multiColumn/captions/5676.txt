Compared with some of these other previous international disasters, interest in the typhoon is lower across all age groups. Among adults 65 and older, 45% followed Haiyan very closely last week, compared to the 67% who closely monitored the Japanese tsunami. Interest has been particularly low among adults younger than 40, just 20% of whom have followed the aftermath in the Philippines last week, compared to the 47% who tracked news from Japan in 2011.
