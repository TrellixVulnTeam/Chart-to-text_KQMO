A 54% majority of the American public said Ford would go down as an “average” president in a Gallup poll last year, while about equal shares thought history will remember him as outstanding or above average (21%) and below average or poor (19%).
A 2011 Pew Research poll asked adults to name the person who had done the best job as president over their lifetime. Less than 1 percent of adults named Ford, even when limited to those who were 18 or older during his presidency. No other president who had served since Herbert Hoover received fewer mentions (Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan topped the list at 34% and 25%, respectively).
