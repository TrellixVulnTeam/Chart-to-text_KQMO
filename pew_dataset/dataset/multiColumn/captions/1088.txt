Notably, among the roughly one-quarter of Republicans who say the Trump administration’s approach to Iran has raised chances of a military conflict, most (65%) say the decision to conduct the airstrike was the right one. Only about a third of Republicans (31%) who say Trump’s approach has raised the likelihood of a military conflict with Iran say it was the wrong decision.
These differences extend to views of the Trump administration’s overall approach toward Iran. A majority of women (62%) say the administration’s approach to Iran has increased the likelihood of a major military conflict; about half of men (47%) say the same.
