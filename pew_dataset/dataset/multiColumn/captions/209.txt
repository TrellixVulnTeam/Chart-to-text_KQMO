This study also examines several other factors that might affect people’s level of engagement and comfort with the contact tracing process. First, it looks at Americans’ openness to answering phone calls from unknown numbers and finds some evidence that even starting the contact tracing process might not be easy in many cases. Just 19% of Americans say they generally answer their cellphones when an unknown phone number calls. Some 67% say they don’t answer but would check a voicemail if one is left. And 14% say they generally don’t answer and would ignore a voicemail.
At the same time, shares of Americans say people pretend to be someone else in order to steal other people’s personal information with some frequency. Some nine-in-ten Americans think it is often (49%) or sometimes (42%) the case that people do this.
