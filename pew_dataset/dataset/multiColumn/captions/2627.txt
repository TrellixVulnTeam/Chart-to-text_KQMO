Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s approach to Pakistan isn’t popular, but his handling of Kashmir is. Modi has shown a willingness to use both diplomacy and military force to engage Pakistan. But despite Modi’s overall popularity in India (88% see him favorably), only 21% of Indians approve of the way he is handling relations with Pakistan. This has stayed roughly constant since 2015, when the question was first asked. In contrast, a clear majority (60%) of Indians approve of Modi’s approach toward Kashmir. Indians ages 18 to 29 are more likely to approve of Modi’s management of the Kashmir situation than those ages 50 and older (64% versus 51%).
