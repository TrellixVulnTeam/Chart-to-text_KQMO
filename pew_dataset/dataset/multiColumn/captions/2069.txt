While all community types gained at least some population from international migration, suburban counties stand out in terms of domestic migration. A net of 6.4 million people have moved from urban and rural areas into the suburbs since 2000 (meaning that 6.4 million more people moved into suburban areas from an urban or rural area than moved out of suburban areas to different types of communities), while cities lost a net of 5.4 million people and rural counties lost 1.0 million people to other community types. Combined with international migration, urban counties gained a net total of only 1.6 million people due to migration and rural counties lost about 400,000, compared with suburban countiesâ€™ gain of 11.7 million people.
