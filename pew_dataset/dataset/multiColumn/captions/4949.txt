Gasoline prices have been dropping since midsummer, and consumers’ confidence about the economy has been on the rise. Could there be a connection?
According to a new Pew Research Center report, 70% of Americans now report hearing mostly good news about gas prices, up from just 15% in August. In truth, gas prices have been falling for months: As of Monday, the national average price of a gallon of self-serve regular was $2.554 — $1.15 less than in late June (representing a nearly one-third drop), according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That’s the cheapest gas has been since October 2009. Also, Brent crude oil has fallen more than $45 a barrel since June and is now below $59 a barrel for the first time since May 2009.
