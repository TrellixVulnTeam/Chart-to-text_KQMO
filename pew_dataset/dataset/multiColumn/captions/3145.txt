The figures, released by the bureau in March, count all arrests made by the federal government, ranging from traditional law enforcement entities, such as the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to less traditional ones, such as the Interior and Treasury departments. They do not include arrests made by state and local authorities, which make the vast majority of U.S. arrests each year (nearly 99% in 2014).
In 2014, DHS made 59% of all federal arrests, up from 37% in 2004 (the earliest year for which data are available following the department’s establishment in 2002). By comparison, DOJ made 35% of all federal arrests in 2014, down from 48% a decade earlier. In fact, just one agency within DHS – Customs and Border Protection – made more arrests in 2014 (64,954) than all of the agencies within DOJ combined (58,265). DOJ agencies include the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the U.S. Marshals Service.
