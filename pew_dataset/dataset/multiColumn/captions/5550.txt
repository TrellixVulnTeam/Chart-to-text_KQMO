The Obama administration has had its share of ups and downs during the last five years when it comes to how the public sees it, but there’s been at least one constant on the positive side — the large number of Americans who have a favorable view of First Lady Michelle Obama.

To be sure, comparing first ladies and how the public views them is a tricky exercise because there is no “job description” for the position and each one has shaped her role in different ways and in different political environments.
