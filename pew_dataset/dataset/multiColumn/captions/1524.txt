Mexican authorities apprehended nearly 92,000 migrants in the first seven months of fiscal 2019, up 32% from the same period the previous year. Still, this year’s total remains below the 141,000 apprehensions made during the same period in fiscal 2006 (when the U.S. also experienced a surge of non-Mexican immigrant apprehensions at the southern border). It’s also far below the number of southern border apprehensions made by the U.S. government during the first seven months of fiscal 2019.
People from the Northern Triangle – El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras – make up 85% of migrants apprehended in Mexico so far in fiscal 2019. Migrants from these countries have historically accounted for the most apprehensions in Mexico, but their share so far in the current fiscal year is the lowest in nearly two decades — 10 percentage points lower than in 2002, when they made up 95% of all apprehensions in Mexico.
Mexican authorities have apprehended 43,000 migrants from Honduras so far this fiscal year, accounting for almost half (47%) of the total. The number of apprehended Honduran immigrants is up 63% over the same period in fiscal 2018. There have been fewer apprehensions of both Guatemalan (25,000) and Salvadoran (10,000) migrants in the first seven months of fiscal 2019, however.
