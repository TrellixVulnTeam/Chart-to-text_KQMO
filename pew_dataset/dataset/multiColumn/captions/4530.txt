It’s easy to see why the company made a big bet on mobile: A 2014 Pew Research Center survey found that 68% of smartphone owners at least occasionally use their device to follow breaking news events. And our analysis of comScore data from January 2015 found that 39 of the top 50 news websites had more traffic to their sites and associated applications coming from mobile devices than from desktop computers. It’s also worth noting just how quickly smartphones have flooded the market: In September of 2012, just before Circa launched, 45% of U.S. adults owned one. By the fall of 2014, that share was up to 64%.
