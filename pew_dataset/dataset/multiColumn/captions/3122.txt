About four-in-ten adults (42%) say they have heard “nothing at all” about the caucus, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted April 5-11 among 1,501 U.S. adults. Another 39% say they have heard “a little” about it, while only about one-in-five Americans (19%) say they have heard “a lot” about the group.
Democrats and Republicans are about equally likely to say they have not heard of the Freedom Caucus. However, in both parties, the caucus is better known among the more ideological. About half (52%) of moderate and liberal Republicans have heard nothing at all about the caucus, compared with just 36% of conservative Republicans. Among Democrats, 47% of conservatives and moderates, compared with 30% of liberals, have heard nothing at all about the caucus.
