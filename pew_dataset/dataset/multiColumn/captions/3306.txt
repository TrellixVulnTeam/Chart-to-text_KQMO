As Trump prepares to take office, 65% say it is more important for the president-elect to focus on domestic policy; far fewer (19%) say it’s more important for him to focus on foreign policy. Majorities have said domestic policy should be the president’s priority for much of the last decade. The last time the public gave as much emphasis to foreign as domestic policy was in 2007, during George W. Bush’s second term. At that time, 40% said it was more important to focus on foreign policy, compared with 39% who said it was more important to focus on domestic policy.
