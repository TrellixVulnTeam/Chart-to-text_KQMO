Men and women who have used online dating sites and apps hold somewhat differing views about how widespread online harassment is on these platforms, according to the most recent survey. For example, while 32% of female users say people being harassed or bullied is a very common occurrence on online dating platforms, that share falls to 19% among male users. These gender differences persist across all age ranges.
Among those who have used an online dating platform – as well as among Americans overall – women are less likely than men to view meeting someone through a dating site or app as safe. Around a third of women who have online dated (36%) believe these platforms are not too or not at all safe for meeting people, compared with 22% of men. Still, majorities of online daters view these platforms as a safe way to meet others.
