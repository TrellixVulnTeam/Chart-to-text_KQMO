Japan is a relatively closed society demographically. The foreign population in Japan accounts for just 1.6% of the country’s population. This is the third-smallest share in any OECD country. And the Japanese feel strongly about their national identity. Roughly nine-in-ten Japanese believe that to be considered truly Japanese, it is very important (70%) or somewhat important (22%) to be able to speak Japanese. A similar portion says it is very (43%) or somewhat important (47%) to share national customs and traditions to identify as Japanese. And roughly three-quarters voice the view that it is very (50%) or somewhat important (27%) to have been born in Japan to be truly Japanese. The intensity of such sentiment is felt most strongly by older Japanese – those ages 50 and older – who are far more likely than those ages 18 to 34 to believe it is very important that a person be born in Japan, speak Japanese and adhere to Japanese customs and traditions to be considered truly Japanese.
