As you might have guessed, the restaurant and food service industry is the single biggest employer of near-minimum workers. Last year, according to our analysis, that industry employed 3.75 million near-minimum workers, about 18% of the total. Many of those workers, presumably, are tipped, so their actual gross pay may be above $10.10 an hour. (Federal law, as well as wage laws in many states, allow tipped employees to be paid less as long as “tip credits” bring their pay up to at least the applicable minimum.)
However, other industries are even more reliant on near-minimum-wage workers. Based on our estimates, industries where more than three-quarters of the hourly workers make more than minimum but less than $10.10 an hour include scrapyards, video-rental stores (the few remaining), mail-order houses, makers of mobile homes and other prefabricated buildings, and car washes.
