The survey also shows that roughly eight-in-ten evangelical Protestants (79%) have a favorable view of the Israeli people, as do seven-in-ten mainline Protestants and about two-thirds of Catholics. People in all three groups are far more likely to say they have a favorable view of the Israeli people than they are to say the same of the Palestinian people.
By contrast, religiously unaffiliated people and those in the historically black Protestant tradition are more ambivalent toward Israelis. Those in both of these groups feel about as warmly toward the Palestinian people as they do toward the Israeli people. (The survey did not include enough interviews with Jews to analyze their views on these questions, because the questions were only asked of half the sample.)
Among all the religious groups analyzed in the survey, the Israeli and Palestinian governments are rated less favorably than the Israeli and Palestinian people. Still, the survey finds the same basic patterns: Evangelicals, mainline Protestants and Catholics are each much more favorably inclined toward the Israeli government than the Palestinian government, while religious “nones” and those in the historically black Protestant tradition view the two governments similarly.
