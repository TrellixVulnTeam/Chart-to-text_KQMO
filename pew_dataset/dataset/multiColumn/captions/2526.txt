And rather than pass stand-alone spending bills as it’s supposed to, Congress has increasingly used omnibus bills (which bundle several appropriations measures into a single, giant law) and full-year CRs to resolve annual spending disputes. The first such omnibus measure was passed in 1950 as a one-off experiment, and omnibus spending bills were used a couple of times in the mid-1980s. However, they’ve become much more frequent in the past two decades: In each of the past seven fiscal years, in fact, all or nearly all of the regular appropriations bills were combined into such after-deadline package deals.
Most federal spending, including spending on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, unemployment compensation and other entitlement programs, is mandated by the statutes governing those programs. That “mandatory” spending totaled about $2.6 trillion in fiscal 2017, or 63% of all federal outlays. “Discretionary” spending, which includes everything from the military and space programs to disaster relief and farm price supports, totaled about $1.2 trillion, or 30% of total outlays. (The remaining 7% or so represents net interest on the federal debt.)
