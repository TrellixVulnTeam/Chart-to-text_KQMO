Americans and Russians strongly disagree over whether the U.S. takes into account other countriesâ€™ interests when it makes foreign policy. A majority of Americans (57%) say Washington does consider other nations, but nearly two-thirds of Russians (65%) say it does not. This sentiment in Russia has been consistent since the question was first posed in 2002. Similarly, most Americans since then have also said the U.S. listens to other countries when making foreign policy. In 2002, however, 75% of Americans said this was the case, compared with 57% seen today.
