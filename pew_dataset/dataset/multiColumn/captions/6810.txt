In contrast to views of news about the oil spill, the publicâ€™s perceptions of economic news have not changed and remain far more negative than positive. Currently, 55%say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about t he economy, while 38% say the economic news they are hearing is mostly bad and just 4% say they are hearing mostly good news about the economy.
That is little changed from early July, when 54% said they were hearing mixed news, and 42% said they were hearing mostly bad news. In June, however, just 30% said they were hearing mostly bad news and 65% said the news was a mix of good and bad.
