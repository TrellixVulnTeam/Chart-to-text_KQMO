Mobile phone users say their devices help them stay in touch with those who live far away. In every country surveyed, about nine-in-ten or more say their phones have helped them in this regard. At the same time, a median of 53% of adults across the 11 countries surveyed say the increasing use of mobile phones has had a good influence on family cohesion, compared with a median of 20% who say it has had a bad influence. People are similarly positive about the impact of the internet on family cohesion.
Even so, a notable share of adults express concerns about the impact of mobile phones on interpersonal communication. For instance, a median of 48% of adults say people should be very concerned about people losing the ability to communicate face-to-face when using their mobile phones. And in focus groups conducted as part of the study, some participants highlighted examples of their children texting from the room next door rather than talking to their family.
