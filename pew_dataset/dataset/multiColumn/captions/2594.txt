After Trump won the 2016 presidential election, Democrats in Congress became increasingly likely to share national news on Facebook. Between Jan. 2, 2015, and Nov. 8, 2016 – the day of the presidential election – just 8% of congressional Democrats’ Facebook posts included links to national news stories. From Jan. 20 through July 20, 2017, however, that number doubled to 16%.
The Center analyzed these reactions and found that, in response to posts from congressional Democrats, the proportion of reactions from the Facebook audience that used the “angry” button more than tripled after the election. From May 1 to Nov. 8, 2016, roughly 5% of reactions to national news links posted by congressional Democrats were “angry” reactions – yet between the election and July 20, 2017, fully 18% of all reactions to Democratic lawmakers’ news links were “angry.” Reactions to Republican-shared news links remained relatively stable. Between May 1 and Nov. 8, 2016, 9% of reactions to Republican posts were “angry,” compared with 10% between Nov. 9, 2016 and July 20, 2017.
