Supporters of some, but not all, populist parties are less favorable toward the UN. Supporters of six populist parties in Europe are less likely than those with an unfavorable opinion of these parties to express a positive opinion of the UN. For example, 48% of those who favor the Czech ANO 2011 party have a positive view of the UN, compared with 69% of those who do not favor this party.
Supporters of five other populist parties are more likely than those with the opposite opinion to see the UN favorably. For example, 78% of those who support Slovakiaâ€™s Ordinary People and Independent Personalities (OLaNO) party have a favorable view of the UN, compared with 61% of those who do not support this party.
