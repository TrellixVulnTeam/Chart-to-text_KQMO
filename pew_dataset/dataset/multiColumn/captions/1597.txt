People who are dissatisfied with democracy in their country are less likely to feel that economic conditions in their country are good, that the financial situation of average people has improved over the past 20 years, and that key democratic norms are being respected, the study finds. Notably, however, dissatisfaction with democracy has little relationship to external assessments of how wealthy or democratic a given country actually is, based on measures from the World Bank, Freedom House, the Economist Intelligence Unit and the Electoral Integrity Project.
People’s assessments of how the average person’s financial situation has changed over the past 20 years are related to dissatisfaction with democracy. In most of the countries surveyed, minorities believe that the average person’s financial situation has improved compared with 20 years ago. This pessimism is strongly related to how people feel about democratic performance. For instance, in Greece, where 7% say the financial situation of average people has gotten better, 84% say they are dissatisfied with how democracy is operating in their country. In contrast, in India, 65% believe the financial situation has improved and just a third are dissatisfied with democracy.
