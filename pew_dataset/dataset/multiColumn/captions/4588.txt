The British want to stay in the EU. The United Kingdom intends to hold a referendum on continued membership in the European Union no later than the end of 2017. While a topic of heated debate in British political and policy circles, the British public’s enthusiasm for leaving the EU has been declining since 2013. That year, the British were evenly split on the issue, with 46% wanting to stay and 46% to leave. In this year’s Pew Research survey, 55% of Brits say they want to remain in the EU, while just 36% voice the desire to go.
