Far fewer members of Congress now have direct military experience than in the past. In the current Congress, 96 members served in the military at some point in their lives, down from 102 in the previous Congress, according to Military Times. There are more than twice as many Republican veterans (66) in the new Congress as Democrats (30). Today, 19% of senators and 18% of representatives have served in the military. (This analysis was conducted prior to the Feb. 10 death of Rep. Walter Jones, a North Carolina Republican who served in the Army National Guard.)
While the number and share of veterans in Congress overall have decreased, the newly elected freshman class boasts the largest number of veterans in a decade (19).
Looking at the longer term, there has been a dramatic decrease in members of Congress with military experience since the late 20th century. Between 1965 and 1975, at least 70% of lawmakers in each legislative chamber had military experience. The share of members with military experience peaked at 75% in 1967 for the House and at 81% in 1975 for the Senate.
