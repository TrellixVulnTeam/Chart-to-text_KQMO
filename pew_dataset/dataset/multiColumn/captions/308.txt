In the summer, before Ginsburg’s death, seven-in-ten U.S. adults said they had a favorable view of the Supreme Court. That included three-quarters of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents and two-thirds of Democrats and Democratic leaners, according to an online survey using the Center’s American Trends Panel.
The overall share of Americans with a favorable opinion of the court in August 2020 was little changed from a year earlier, when 69% expressed a positive view. But the share of Republicans with a favorable opinion declined 10 percentage points in that span (from 85% to 75%), and the share of Democrats with a positive view rose 10 points (from 57% to 67%).
