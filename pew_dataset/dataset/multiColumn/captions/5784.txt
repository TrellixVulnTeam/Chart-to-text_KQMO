Since taking office earlier this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping has emphasized the need to crackdown on corruption, promising to pursue both high-level and low-level officials (“tigers” and “flies”). Among the country’s average citizens, corruption is a growing concern. Fully 84% described political corruption as a big problem in a spring 2013 Pew Research Center survey of China. More than half (53%) said it was a very big problem, up from 39% five years ago. Among the 17 issues included on the survey, only inflation (59% very big problem) was rated as a bigger concern.
