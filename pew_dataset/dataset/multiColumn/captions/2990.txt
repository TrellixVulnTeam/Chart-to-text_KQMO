When it comes to views about some potential contributing factors to gun violence, Democrats and Republicans deeply disagree over the degree to which legally obtained guns contribute to gun violence. About three-quarters (76%) of Democrats say the ease with which people can legally obtain guns contributes a great deal or fair amount to gun violence, compared with just 39% of Republicans.
By contrast, more than eight-in-ten Republicans (84%) and Democrats (88%) say the ease with which people can illegally obtain guns contributes a great deal or a fair amount to gun violence.
