For their part, most Americans say they are interested in news about other major world powers. Nearly seven-in-ten Americans surveyed in the fall of 2017 say they are interested in what happens in Great Britain (69%), China (69%) and Russia (68%). And roughly two-thirds say the same about Germany and Japan (66% each).
Mutual interest between publics in the U.S. and other major powers diverges in several cases. For example, while 68% of Americans say they are interested in news about Russia, only 48% of Russians say they closely follow news about the U.S. And while 61% of Americans are interested in news about France, just 50% of French people say they closely follow news about the U.S.
