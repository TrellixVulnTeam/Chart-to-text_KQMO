A small number of highly active bots were responsible for a large share of links to prominent news and media sites. We found that the 500 most active suspected bot accounts were responsible for 22% of the tweeted links to popular news and current events sites during the study period. By comparison, the 500 most active human users were responsible for a much smaller share (an estimated 6%) of tweeted links to these outlets.
Note: These findings are based on an analysis of a sample of 1.2 million public tweets collected via Twitter’s streaming API between July 27 and Sept. 6, 2017, containing links to popular websites. See the report’s Methodology section for more details.
