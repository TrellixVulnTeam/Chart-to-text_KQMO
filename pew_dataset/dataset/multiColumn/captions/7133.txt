More than one-in-five (22%) cited Obamaâ€™s trip when asked which of six top stories they followed most closely last week. Still, the latest weekly News Interest Index survey, conducted April 3-6 by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, shows that economic troubles at home were not far behind: 17% say they followed reports about rising unemployment most closely and 13% say they followed reports about financial problems in the U.S. auto industry most closely.
