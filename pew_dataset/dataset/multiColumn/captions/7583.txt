President Bush received a striking 78% of the votes of white evangelicals in 2004, up 10 percentage points from 2000 and by far his highest level of support from any demographic group in the population. As he began his second term in office, the president had an approval rating of 72% among evangelicals, compared with 50% in the public as a whole.
But evangelicals’ ratings of the president have declined as much since January 2005 as they have among the rest of the public. One year ago in the aftermath of the federal government’s response to Hurricane Katrina, just 54% of evangelicals approved of Bush’s performance in office; his overall approval rating was 36%. Since then, the president’s ratings among evangelicals have fluctuated, rallying to 64% in December 2005 and slumping to a low of 52% in July of this year. Today, Bush’s rating among evangelicals is 57%, compared with 37% among the public overall.
