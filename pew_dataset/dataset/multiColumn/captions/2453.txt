A growing share of Catholics see the pope as being too liberal (34%) as well as naïve (24%), up from 19% and 15%, respectively, in 2015. This is especially true among Catholics who are Republican or who lean Republican; they are much more likely to see Francis as being too liberal than Democrats or those who lean Democratic (55% vs. 19%). A partisan gap also exists among Catholics on views about whether the pope is naïve (32% among Republicans vs. 18% among Democrats).
