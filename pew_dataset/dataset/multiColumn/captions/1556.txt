There are substantial partisan gaps in views of discrimination against religious groups. For example, Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party are more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to say Muslims face at least some discrimination in the U.S. (92% vs. 69%). Democrats also are more likely than Republicans to say Jews face discrimination (70% vs. 55%). At the same time, Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say evangelicals face discrimination (70% vs. 32%).
