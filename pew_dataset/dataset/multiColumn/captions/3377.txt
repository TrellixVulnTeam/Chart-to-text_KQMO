With public support for the death penalty at its lowest point in more than four decades, the U.S. will end the year with its fewest executions in a quarter century.
Nationwide, 20 inmates were executed in 2016, according to a report from the Death Penalty Information Center. Thatâ€™s the fewest since 1991, when 14 inmates were executed. In every other year since 1992, the U.S. executed at least 28 people.
