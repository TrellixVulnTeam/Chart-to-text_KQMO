About six-in-ten Americans (61%) expect that Republicans and Democrats in Washington will bicker and oppose one another more than usual, while just 29% say they expect the parties to work together more.
Majorities have expected the parties to bicker and oppose rather than work together in recent years, though public predictions for partisan cooperation were substantially higher on the eve of Barack Obamaâ€™s inauguration eight years ago. In January 2009, 50% expected the two parties to work together more, while fewer (39%) expected greater hostility.
