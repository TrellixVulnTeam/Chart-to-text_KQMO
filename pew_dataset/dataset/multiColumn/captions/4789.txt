Hispanics are significantly more likely than whites to say the Earth is warming because of human activities and that the U.S. should do whatever it takes to protect the environment, a new Pew Research Center analysis finds.
In a recent survey, we ask if there is solid evidence that the Earth has been warming over the past few decades. Seven-in-ten Hispanics say the Earth is warming because of human activity, a higher share than among whites (44%). More than half (56%) of blacks say the same. About two-in-ten Hispanics and whites and a quarter of blacks say the Earth is warming because of natural patterns.
Overall, a quarter of Americans say there is no solid evidence of global warming. Just 11% of Hispanics and 17% of blacks say there is no solid evidence the Earth is getting warmer, while 31% of whites say the same.
