In that same survey, Greeks expressed relatively high levels of anti-American sentiment. Just 39% in Greece expressed positive views of the U.S., among the lowest measured in the spring 39-nation survey. Only publics in Turkey, the Palestinian territories, Egypt, Jordan, and Pakistan thought worse of America.
This negative impression of the U.S. coincides with less than stellar views of President Obama. Only about a third of Greeks (35%) have confidence in the American president to handle international affairs, with 62% expressing little or no confidence.
