Last July, unfavorable opinions of the Supreme Court rose to their highest level in 25 years, following the Courtâ€™s ruling upholding most of the 2010 health care law. A December survey showed that views of the court had changed little since that point. In the most recent survey, 53% said they had a favorable view of the Supreme Court, while 36% had an unfavorable view. In July 37% said they had an unfavorable opinion of the court.
