President Bush’s job approval rating reached its 2004 peak, at 58%, in early January following the capture of Saddam Hussein. Since February, Bush’s ratings have fluctuated between 43% and 48%. Bush’s current standing (48% approve, 43% disapprove) is somewhat higher than the 43% rating he received in early April, after the eruption of violence in and around Fallujah, and his 44% mark in May, following revelations of prisoner abuse by U.S. troops at Abu Ghraib.
