While the partisan gap in personal evaluations has not widened noticeably in recent years (after a brief enlargement in 2005), it remains significant. That is, again, unsurprising given that Republicans are, on average, significantly better off financially than either Democrats or independents. About one-in-three Republicans (32%) in recent Pew surveys has an annual income above $75,000, compared with 22% of Democrats and 25% of independents. By the same token 60% of Republicans rate their personal financial situation as good or excellent, compared with only 40% of Democrats and 45% of independents.
