“Cuban” is the identity term used most often. When asked in a 2013 Pew Research Center survey what term they use to describe themselves most often, a majority of Cuban adults (63%) say they most often use term “Cuban.” About two-in-ten (19%) say they describe themselves most often as “American.” Only about one-in-ten (11%) most often use the pan-ethnic terms of “Hispanic” or “Latino” to describe their identity. By comparison, 54% of all U.S. Hispanics say they prefer their ancestor’s Hispanic origin term to describe their identity, 23% say they describe themselves most often as “American” and two-in-ten use the pan-ethnic terms of “Hispanic” or “Latino” to describe their identity.
In regard to the pan-ethnic terms of “Hispanic” or “Latino,” about half of Cuban adults (51%) have no preference for either term. Among those who have a preference, more prefer the term “Hispanic” (29% of all Cubans), while some 19% prefer the term “Latino.” By comparison, half of all Hispanic adults have no preference for either term; among those who do have a preference, Hispanic is favored over Latino 2-to-1.
When asked in the 2013 Pew Research survey whether they thought of themselves as a typical American or very different from a typical American, 55% of Cuban adults see themselves as a typical American, while about four-in-ten (37%) think of themselves as very different from a typical American. By comparison, Hispanic adults overall are less likely to think of themselves as typical Americans (49%) compared with Cubans, and on balance Hispanic adults are more likely to see themselves as a typical American (49%) than very different from a typical American (44%).
