About three-in-ten (29%) say they followed news about the Anthony verdict very closely, though this was far and away the most closely followed story (37%). The number following the verdict very closely is comparable to the 30% that said they followed the verdict in the O.J. Simpson civil trial this closely in February 1997. Women are much more likely than men to say the Anthony verdict was the story they followed most closely (45% vs. 29%).
Another quarter (25%) say they followed news about the deficit and debt discussions in Washington very closely; 14% say this was the news they followed most closely. There is little difference in interest among partisans (30% of Republicans, 27% of Democrats and 23% of independents say they followed this news very closely). But within the ranks of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, those who agree with the Tea Party movement are much more likely than others to say they followed this news very closely (41% vs. 21%).
Fully 15% say they followed news about the launch of the final space shuttle mission very closely; 5% say this was their top story. News about the historic shuttle launch made up 5% of coverage. Just 6% say they very closely followed news about the sexual assault case against Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund. This was the story followed most closely by 1%. The Strauss-Kahn story made up 3% of the newshole.
