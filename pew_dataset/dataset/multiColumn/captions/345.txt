People in other countries overwhelmingly believe the U.S. has done a bad job dealing with COVID-19. Across the 13 countries surveyed this summer, a median of 84% of adults say the U.S. has done a bad job dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, including 53% who say it has done a very bad job. A median of only 15% of adults in the surveyed countries see the U.S. response positively.
Opinions about the U.S. response are especially negative in South Korea, Denmark, Germany and Belgium. In each of these countries, around nine-in-ten adults say the U.S. response to COVID-19 has been bad, including roughly two-thirds in South Korea (66%) and Belgium (64%) who say it has been very bad.
