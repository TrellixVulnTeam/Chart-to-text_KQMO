The share expressing negative views of both parties has been higher in recent years than in the 2000s or 1990s. In the 2008 presidential election year, 12% viewed both parties unfavorably. In 2004, 10% did so, and in 2000, just 7% expressed unfavorable opinions of both the Republican and Democratic parties.
Yet the rise in frustration with the parties, especially this year, is not the result of an across-the-board increase in negative views. Instead, it is largely concentrated among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, who have become increasingly critical of the Republican Party.
Currently, 36% of independents express unfavorable opinions of both parties, as do 22% of Republicans and just 9% of Democrats. The biggest shift in opinion has come among Republicans, whose unfavorable impression of both parties is more than double the percentage in January (9%). Democratsâ€™ unfavorable view of the two parties is little changed from the start of the year (8%).
Among independents, there has been a particularly stark rise in the unfavorable views of both parties among Republican-leaning independents, while there is little change in these views among Democratic leaners. Nearly half (47%) of Republican leaners have an unfavorable impression of both the Republican and Democratic parties, up from 32% in January and the highest percentage measured since 1992. Among Democratic-leaning independents, as among Democrats, there has been almost no change since January (22% today, 21% then).
