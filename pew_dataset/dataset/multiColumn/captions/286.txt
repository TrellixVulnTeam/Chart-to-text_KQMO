Those who say it is never acceptable to use an anonymous source are roughly three times as likely to say it has a great deal of influence on whether they think a story is credible (49% vs. 15% of those who say it is acceptable in special cases and 14% of those who say always acceptable). Still, majorities of all three groups say that an anonymous source has at least some influence on their trust in a story.
