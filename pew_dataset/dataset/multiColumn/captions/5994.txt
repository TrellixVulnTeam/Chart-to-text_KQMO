According to our data, the Martin case emerged as the No. 1 story in the mainstream press the week of March19-25, 2012—following the release of Zimmerman’s 911 calls. That week, it accounted for 19% of the newshole, making it the first story in 2012 to generate more coverage in a single week than the presidential campaign. (The term newshole refers to the space devoted to each subject in print and online and time on radio and TV.) At that point, about one-third of Americans (35%) said they were following news about the case very closely, making it one of the top stories in 2012 in terms of the level of public attention.
