Some 3% of American adults use ride-hailing apps on a daily or weekly basis, and around two-thirds of these regular ride-hailing users indicate that they own a car or regularly drive a personal vehicle. Although this means that a majority of these regular ride-hailing users are car owners/drivers, they are significantly less likely to own or drive a car than either occasional ride-hailing users or Americans who do not use ride-hailing at all.
Yet although they are less dependent on personal vehicle ownership, these regular ride-hailing users rely heavily on a wide range of personal transportation options that go well beyond ride-hailing alone – such as taking public transit, walking or riding a bike, or even using traditional taxi services. To be sure, this trend carries a strong geographic component: For Americans who live far from urban centers, a personal vehicle might be the only available option to get from one place to another. But for those with the option of doing so, ride-hailing apps can serve as one element among many in a network of transportation options that can help reduce users’ reliance on personal vehicle ownership.
