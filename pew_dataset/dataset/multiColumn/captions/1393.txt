The news media’s watchdog role is seen as more of a necessary check among black adults than among whites. About three-quarters of blacks (74%) say that news organizations’ criticism of political leaders – known as the media’s “watchdog” role – keeps these leaders from doing things that shouldn’t be done. A similar portion of Hispanics (72%) say the same, but that share drops to 65% among whites.
And while a majority of Americans say news organizations tend to favor one side when dealing with political and social issues, blacks are more closely split on the matter. Among black adults, 41% say news organizations deal fairly with all sides, compared with 56% who say news organizations tend to favor one side. In comparison, whites are more likely to say that news organizations tend to favor one side (76% say this).
