Two-thirds of Muslims in the United States (67%) say the country needs to continue making changes to give blacks equal rights with whites, a higher percentage than the share of Americans in general who say this (57%).
Muslim Americans are also more likely than the general public to say there is a lot of discrimination against black people in the U.S. About seven-in-ten U.S. Muslims (71%) say this, compared with 59% of the overall population, according to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey.
Still, even when those who identify solely as black are excluded, U.S. Muslims are more likely than Americans overall to say more changes are needed for black people to have equal rights with whites (66% vs. 53%) and are more likely to say there is a lot of discrimination against blacks (66% vs 56%).
