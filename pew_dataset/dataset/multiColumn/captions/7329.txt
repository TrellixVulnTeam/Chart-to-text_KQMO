Comparable proportions of Democrats who are college graduates (88%) and those with less education (82%) say that there is solid evidence that the earth is getting warmer. Among Democrats, higher education is associated with the belief that global warming is mostly caused by human activity. Fully 75% of Democrats with college degrees say that the earth is warming and that this is caused by human activity. Just 52% of Democrats with less education express this view.
Among Republicans, similar percentages of college graduates and those with less education say there is solid evidence of global warming (46% and 51%, respectively). Yet for Republicans, unlike Democrats, higher education is associated with greater skepticism that human activity is causing global warming. Only 19% of Republican college graduates say that there is solid evidence that the earth is warming and it is caused by human activity, while 31% of Republicans with less education say the same.
