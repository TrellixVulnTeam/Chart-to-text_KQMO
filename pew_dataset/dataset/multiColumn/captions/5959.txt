Pew Research surveys going back to 1987 show only a quarter to a third of Americans agreeing with the statement that “We should make every possible effort to improve the position of blacks and other minorities, even if it means giving them preferential treatment.” But support is sharply split by race: When we asked the question last year, 62% of blacks and 59% of Hispanics agreed with the statement but only 22% of whites did. And while 44% of 18- to 29-year-olds agreed, about a third of all other age groups did.
