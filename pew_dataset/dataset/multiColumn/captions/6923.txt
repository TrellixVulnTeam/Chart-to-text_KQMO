Two-thirds of Americans (66%) say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy, which is little changed since early February (61%) or early January (65%). Meanwhile, the number that says they are hearing mostly bad news about the economy now stands at 30%. It had been 35% at the start of February and 29% in early January. Just 4% say they are hearing mostly good news about the economy, essentially unchanged from earlier in the year.
When asked about specific elements of the economy, Americans are most likely to say they are hearing bad news about the employment picture. The federal government announced March 5 that the unemployment rate was 9.7% in February, unchanged from January. Currently, 59% say they are hearing mostly bad news about the jobs situation, about the same as the 61% that said this in January.
