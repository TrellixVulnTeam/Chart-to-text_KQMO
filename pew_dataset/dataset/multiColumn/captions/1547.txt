Concurrently, the center of political gravity in the European Parliament has shifted to the right. Historically, the three main groupings representing the center-left, center-right and centrist liberals held three-quarters or more of seats, but in the 2009 election their collective share slipped to 73%, and in 2014 it fell further to 64%. Parties classified as right-wing to far right now hold a fifth of European Parliament seats, more than double their share two decades ago. And after years of post-Cold War decline, parties categorized as left-wing to far left won 7% of seats in 2014, their biggest win in 15 years.
