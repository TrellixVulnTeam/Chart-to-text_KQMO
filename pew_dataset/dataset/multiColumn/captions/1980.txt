Americans have more confidence in the leaders of France, Japan and Germany to do the right thing regarding world affairs than they have in U.S. President Donald Trump, according to a Pew Research Center poll conducted earlier this year.
Majorities in the U.S. view French President Emmanuel Macron, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and German Chancellor Angela Merkel with confidence, while about half (48%) are confident that Trump will do the right thing internationally.
Of the seven leaders tested in the survey, Americans have the lowest levels of confidence in Russian President Vladimir Putin, with about one-in-five (21%) saying he will do the right thing in world affairs. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi receive equivalent ratings: About four-in-ten (39%) in the U.S. have confidence in each.
