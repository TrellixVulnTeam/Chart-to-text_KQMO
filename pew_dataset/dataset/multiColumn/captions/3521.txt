In one indicator of their commitment to help others, 73% of Japanese believe that Japanese companies should increase their investment in developing nations. Just 19% oppose such business activity. Roughly as many Japanese (71%) support importing more goods from developing nations in Asia, Africa and Latin America. Again, only a fifth of the public opposes such commercial help for poor nations. And 66% of Japanese back increasing foreign aid to developing countries, while 27% oppose boosting such assistance. (Currently, Japan commits 0.22% of its gross national income to foreign aid, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. By comparison, the U.S. donates 0.17% and the UK 0.71%.) Notably, Japanese men (74%) are more likely than women (58%) to support increased foreign aid for developing countries.)
