These trends are going to put a lot of pressure on Japan’s working-age population down the line. By 2050, there will be 72 elderly people (ages 65 and older) for every 100 people of working age, doubling the 2010 ratio of 36 per 100. Indeed, Japan’s old-age dependency ratio is among the highest in the world. Looking at other top economies, Japan’s not alone. Germany’s ratio is projected to be 60 per 100 in 2050, France’s is 44, China’s is 39, and the U.S.’s is 36.
