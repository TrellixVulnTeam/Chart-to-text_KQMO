Among those who know that most immigrants in the U.S. are here legally, a large 77%-majority says that undocumented immigrants are no more likely to commit serious crimes than American citizens. By contrast, a smaller share of those who think most immigrants are here illegally (53%) say undocumented immigrants are no more likely to commit serious crimes.
This relationship is seen within both parties. Among Republicans and Republican leaners, most of those who believe the majority of immigrants are in the U.S. legally (60%) think undocumented immigrants are no more likely to commit serious crimes than American citizens. Among Republicans who incorrectly think most immigrants are here illegally, 52% say undocumented immigrants are more likely to commit serious crimes, compared with 38% who say they are not.
