Those in every country surveyed worry about the impact of mobile phones on children. Across these 11 emerging economies, a median of 79% of adults say people should be very concerned about children being exposed to harmful or immoral content when using their phones. In most countries, half or more say mobile phones and the internet have had a bad impact on children â€“ more than the percentage who say they are concerned about the influence of technology on other facets of society included in the survey, such as politics, local culture and morality.
Parents are taking steps to monitor and regulate what their child does online or on their mobile phone. A median of 52% of parents whose children have a mobile phone say they at times limit how much time their child spends on their phone, and a median of 50% say they ever monitor what their child is looking at or doing on their mobile phone.
