Democrats and Republicans also differ in their feelings about their own personal safety and in their recent religious attendance habits. For instance, Democrats are far less confident than Republicans in their ability to safely attend services in person: Eight-in-ten Republican congregants (79%) say that they are “very” or “somewhat” confident that they could safely attend religious services without catching or spreading the coronavirus, while 44% of Democratic attenders agree. And among partisans who attend services regularly (according to a 2019 survey), far fewer in each group say they have actually attended in-person religious services in the past month, but, again, Republicans (42%) are twice as likely as Democrats (19%) to report doing so.
