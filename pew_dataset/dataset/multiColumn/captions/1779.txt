Even before any departures resulting from this week’s meeting, United Methodists have been shrinking considerably as a share of the U.S. population, part of a broader trend among U.S. Christians and particularly mainline Protestants. Our 2014 study found that United Methodists make up 3.6% of the U.S. adult population – down from 5.1% in 2007. (Mainline Protestants as a whole declined from 18.1% of the adult population to 14.7% over that seven-year period.)
