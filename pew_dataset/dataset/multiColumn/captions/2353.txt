About four-in-ten Americans (42%) say they think of Russia as a serious problem, but not an adversary; fewer (28%) consider Russia an adversary and 24% say the country is not much of a problem. Overall public views are about the same as there were in January 2017, shortly before Donald Trump took office.
As was the case then, about twice as many Republicans (33%) as Democrats (17%) say Russia is “not much of a problem.” However, somewhat fewer Democrats view Russia as an adversary than did so in January 2017 (30% now, 38% then), though the share describing it as either a serious problem or an adversary is little changed. Republicans’ views of Russia have changed little over this period.
