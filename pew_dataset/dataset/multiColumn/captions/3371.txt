Trump’s victory another example of how Electoral College wins are bigger than popular vote ones
For the fifth time in U.S. history, and the second time this century, a presidential candidate won the White House while losing the popular vote. This mismatch between the electoral and popular votes came about because Trump won several large states (such as Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) by very narrow margins, gaining all their electoral votes in the process, even as Clinton claimed other large states (such as California, Illinois and New York) by much wider margins. Trump’s share of the popular vote, in fact, was the seventh-smallest winning percentage since 1828, when presidential campaigns began to resemble those of today.
