In absolute terms, the pay of Latino workers increased over the 1990s, but not as rapidly as for non-Hispanic whites. In 2000 the average full-time, year-round Hispanic worker earned about $31,000, or about 60 percent of what non-Hispanic whites earned. The pay of whites was up so sharply that the overall pay gap between white and Hispanic workers increased by $7,000 for men and $5,000 for women.
