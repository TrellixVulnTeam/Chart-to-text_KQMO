Immigrants in general, but especially the unauthorized are considerably more likely than natives to have very low levels of education. For example, less than 2% of natives have less than a 9th grade education, but 15% of legal immigrants and 32% of unauthorized migrants have this little education. (Note that education in Mexico is currently compulsory only through the 8th grade, so finding this many with this little education is not surprising. Further, the level of compulsory school attendance was recently raised from 6th grade.)
