Americans and Germans have different views about what the most important aspect of the U.S.-German relationship is. Roughly a third of Americans say the most important aspects of the relationship – from a list of three options – are security and defense ties (34%) and economic and trade ties (33%). About one-in-five (21%) name shared democratic values as the pre-eminent aspect of the relationship.
Most Germans, by contrast, say economic connections are the most critical (45%), with about a third saying democratic values are the keystone of the transatlantic relationship (35%). Only 16% of Germans cite defense ties.
