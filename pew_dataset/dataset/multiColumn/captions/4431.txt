Teens use a number of platforms and devices to keep in touch with friends, but text messaging is used on a daily basis much more than others. Roughly nine-in-ten teens (88%) spend time with their friends via text messaging at least occasionally, and 55% do so every day. Phone calling, instant messaging and social media are also popular ways for teens to spend time with friends, but in comparison with texting, they are used far less for daily interactions. Few teens keep in touch with friends on a daily basis by email or video chatting.
