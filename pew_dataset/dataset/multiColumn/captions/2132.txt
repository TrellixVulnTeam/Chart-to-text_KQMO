Republicans and Democrats are in general agreement on their feelings about Britain. Majorities in both parties (63% of Democrats and 59% of Republicans) feel warmly toward Britain, with about four-in-ten in both saying they feel very warmly.
These feelings are little changed since 2016, although Republicans are slightly less likely to feel very warmly toward Britain (46% in 2016, 37% now); Democrats are somewhat more likely to feel very warmly (37% in 2016, 43% now).
A 55% majority of Democrats express warm feelings toward Germany, compared with 37% of Republicans. Virtually all of the partisan difference in feelings toward Germany is in the share of those who feel very warmly: 36% of Democrats, compared with 19% of Republicans.
