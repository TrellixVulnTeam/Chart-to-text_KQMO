While the national media focused almost exclusively on election-related news last week, the public continued to keep close track of economic news. Fully 54% followed news about the economy very closely and another 31% followed fairly closely. Roughly three-in-ten (29%) listed the economy as their most closely followed news story. According to Pew’s PEJ, the media devoted 7% of its overall coverage to the economic crisis.
Americans also paid close attention to the nation’s rising unemployment rate. Fully 39% followed the latest unemployment reports very closely and another 32% paid fairly close attention to this story. Interest in unemployment news was significantly higher than in June of this year, amid reports of widespread job losses.
