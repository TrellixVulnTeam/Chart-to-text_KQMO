Americans were also asked about their expectations for space tourism in the next 50 years. The public is split over whether this will happen, with half saying that people will routinely travel in space as tourists by 2068 and half saying this will not happen.

About one-third of Americans (32%) say people will build colonies on other planets that can be lived in for long periods by 2068.
