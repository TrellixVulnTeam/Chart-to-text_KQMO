But the difference, while statistically significant, was small in absolute terms – smaller than the margin of sampling error in most polls. Obama’s average lead across the six surveys was 9.9 points among registered voters when cell phone and landline interviews were combined and weighted. If estimates had been based only on the weighted landline samples, Obama’s average lead would have been 7.6 points, an average bias of 2.3 percentage points on the margin, or about 1.2 points expressed as candidate error. Limiting the analysis to likely voters rather than all voters produced similar results. Obama’s average lead among likely voters was 8.2 points across all six dual frame surveys versus 5.8 points (or 1.2 points as candidate error) when the landline samples are analyzed alone. (See the appendix for a detailed description of the sampling and weighting employed in this analysis.)
