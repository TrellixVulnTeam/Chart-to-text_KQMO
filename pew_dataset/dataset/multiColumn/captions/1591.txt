Among Latinos and Asians, the voter turnout rate in 2018 for naturalized citizens was higher than among the U.S. born. The naturalized-citizen turnout rate among Latinos was 44.2%, higher than the 39.0% turnout for U.S.-born Latinos. (Naturalized citizens are immigrants who have become U.S. citizens. Latinos and Asians are the nationâ€™s two largest immigrant groups.) This gap between the Latino groups narrowed from 2014, when turnout was 35.2% and 24.2%, respectively. For Asians, naturalized citizens had a turnout rate of 42.7% compared with 36.7% for those born in the U.S. Those figures are up from 29.6% and 22.4% in 2014. Among all U.S. eligible voters, by contrast, the 2018 turnout rate of naturalized citizens trailed that of the U.S. born, 45.7% to 54.2%, a similar pattern as in recent elections.
