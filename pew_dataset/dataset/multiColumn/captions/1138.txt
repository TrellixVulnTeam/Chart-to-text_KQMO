The U.S. public renders a harsh judgment on the state of political discourse in the country today. Large majorities of Americans say the tone and nature of political debate has become more negative in recent years, as well as less respectful, less fact-based and less substantive. President Donald Trump is a major factor in peopleâ€™s views: A 55% majority says Trump has changed the tone and nature of political debate in the country for the worse. Fewer than half as many (24%) say he has changed it for the better, while 20% say he has had little impact.
