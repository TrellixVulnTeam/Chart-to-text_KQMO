The Boomers who were in the labor force last year are different demographically from those out of the labor force – most of whom have retired. About four-in-ten Boomers in the labor force (38%) had at least a bachelor’s degree, versus 27% of those not in the labor force. In addition, the labor force participants were slightly more likely to be non-Hispanic white and to reside in a metropolitan area.
