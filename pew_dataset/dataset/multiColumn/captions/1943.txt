Socioeconomic status also affects the congregational characteristics that church shoppers value most. Location is particularly important to more affluent, well-educated adults. Roughly three-quarters of church shoppers who either are college educated or who have household incomes of $75,000 or more (77% and 75%, respectively) say location played an important role in their choice of a new congregation. By comparison, about two-thirds of church shoppers either with a high school degree or less or a household income of less than $30,000 (64% and 67%, respectively) say location is important.
Church shoppers in the lowest income bracket are the most likely to choose a congregation that offers opportunities to volunteer in the local community, or to choose a congregation because their friends or family worship there.
