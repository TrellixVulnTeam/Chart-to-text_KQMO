While many Americans get news from social media, few are heavily engaged with news. Only about a quarter (26%) of social media news consumers often click on links to news stories on social media. And only 16% often “like” news stories. Even fewer say they often comment on (8%), share (11%) or discuss (5%) news stories on social media.
