The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last week that the birth rate among 15- to 19-year-olds had fallen to a record low 31.3 births per 1,000 in 2011. Teen birth rates dropped for all racial and ethnic groups, but fell the most among Hispanic teens: from 75.3 per 1,000 in 2007 to 49.4 per 1,000 in 2011.
Teen births have been trending lower for the past three decades. In 1991, the birth rate for all teens was 61.8 per 1,000, according to the CDC. But the decline has accelerated since the start of the Great Recession: from 41.5 per 1,000 in 2007 to 31.3 in 2011, a 25% drop. (While fertility rates fell during that period for all age groups except 40 and above, the declines were sharpest for women in their teens and 20s.)
