There is little public support for a complete reversal of Roe v. Wade. In a survey from December 2016 – the last time the Center asked about it – around three-in-ten U.S. adults (28%) said they would like to see the Supreme Court completely overturn Roe v. Wade, but around seven-in-ten (69%) said they would not.
