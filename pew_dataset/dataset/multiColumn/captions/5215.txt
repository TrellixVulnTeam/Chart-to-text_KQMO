Mexicans are divided over President Enrique Peña Nieto, with 51% expressing a favorable opinion and 48% viewing him unfavorably, including 30% who give a very unfavorable assessment. Since 2012, negative attitudes toward the president have increased 10 percentage points. Mexicans age 50 and older, those who live in rural areas, and residents of Mexico’s Central region have a more positive impression of the president.
Peña Nieto receives the highest rating among the leaders asked about on the survey. Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the PRD’s candidate during the 2012 presidential elections who recently broke away to found his own party, the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), garners positive ratings from just 36% of the public. About six-in-ten (61%) view him negatively, relatively unchanged from 2012.
Marcelo Ebrard, who served as mayor of Mexico City for six years, also remains unpopular. Only 23% express favorable views of this PRD-aligned politician, while 57% give him a negative rating.
