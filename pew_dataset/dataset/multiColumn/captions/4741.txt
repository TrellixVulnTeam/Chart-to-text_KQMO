New mothers today who worked during their pregnancy are more likely than new mothers in the early 1980s to use some form of paid leave (which consists largely of maternity leave, but also includes sick and vacation leave, among other types) either while pregnant or in the 12 weeks after the birth. In the late 2000s, about half (51%) of these women used paid leave, while in the early 1980s, just 37% did.
Unlike its developed-world counterparts, the U.S. does not mandate any paid leave for new mothers under federal law, though some individual employers make that accommodation and it is mandated by a handful of individual states. By contrast, Estonia offers about two years of paid leave, and Hungary and Lithuania offer more than one year of fully paid leave, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. While U.S. law mandates no paid leave, it does require 12 weeks of protected leave to eligible employees.
A higher share of U.S. women who had their first child between 2006 and 2008 used unpaid leave (42%) – the kind Young received from UPS – than in the early 1980s (34%), according to census data. Conversely, the share of women who were fired from or quit their jobs declined from 39% to 27% during that same time period.
