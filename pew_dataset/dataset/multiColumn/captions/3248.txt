As Americans have become more negative on China, they have also become more downbeat about their country’s global stature. In 2016, a 46% plurality of Americans said the U.S. plays a less important and powerful role as a world leader compared with 10 years ago. This figure was up 26 percentage points from 2004, when just 20% believed American power was waning.
The Chinese public, on the other hand, sees its country’s influence on the rise. Three-quarters of Chinese believe their country is playing a more important role in the world today compared with a decade ago.
