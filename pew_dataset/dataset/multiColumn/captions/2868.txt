Partisans also continue to have contrasting expectations for the next generation. Again, overall opinions have changed little since last year. And more people say the future for the next generation of Americans will be worse today (48%) than did so in either 2009 (32%) or 2008 (34%), during the economic recession.
Among members of both parties, more say prospects for the next generation will be worse than better. Among Republicans, 46% say the future for the next generation will be worse, while 30% say it will be better and 21% about the same. Still, this represents a sharp improvement in opinion among Republicans since last year, when 61% said the future would be worse and just 16% better (18% said about the same).
