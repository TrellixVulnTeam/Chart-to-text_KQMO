The character of the person who occupies the Oval Office matters to the vast majority of Americans. Across party lines and religious groups, roughly nine-in-ten or more say it is either somewhat or very important to have a president who lives a moral, ethical life. But Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party are more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to say it is “very” important (71% vs. 53%), according to a recent Pew Research Center survey.
Fewer Americans (52%) say it’s either somewhat (32%) or very (20%) important for a president to have strong religious beliefs, even if those beliefs are different from their own. But Republicans place more of a premium on having a president who is religious: About two-thirds of Republicans (65%) say this trait is at least somewhat important, compared with four-in-ten Democrats who say this (41%).
Generally speaking, when it comes to traits that are important for a president to have, Americans care less about having a president who shares their religious beliefs than they do about having one who stands up for their religious beliefs. Four-in-ten U.S. adults (39%) say it’s at least somewhat important for a president to share their religious beliefs – though Republicans (53%) are about twice as likely as Democrats (27%) to say that this matters.
