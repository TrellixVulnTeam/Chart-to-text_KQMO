When playing games with others online, many teen gamers (especially boys) connect with their fellow players via voice connections in order to engage in collaboration, conversation and trash-talking. Among boys who play games with others online, fully 71% use voice connections to engage with other players (this compares with just 28% of girls who play in networked environments).
All this playing, hanging out and talking while playing games leads many teens to feel closer to friends.
Social media helps teens feel more connected to their friendsâ€™ feelings and daily lives, and also offers teens a place to receive support from others during challenging times.
