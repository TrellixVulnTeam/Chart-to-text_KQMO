California’s death row has grown by nearly 100 inmates, or 14%, since January 2006, when it carried out its last execution, and by 28% since 2000, according to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which tracks death row populations in all states. (The most recent available data for all states are as of October 2018.) The increase reflects the fact that California juries have continued to sentence convicted defendants to death, even as executions themselves have been on hold in recent years amid legal and political disputes that predated Newsom’s formal moratorium.
One stark reflection of the longtime suspension of capital punishment in California is that executions are the third most common cause of death for those on death row, following natural causes and suicide, according to data from the state’s corrections department. Just 15 of the 135 California death row inmates who have died since 1978 were executed.
