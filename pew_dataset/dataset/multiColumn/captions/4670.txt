The latest Pew Research Center News IQ survey finds that, nearly half a century after the death of Martin Luther King Jr., an overwhelming majority of Americans (91%) are able to identify the civil rights leader from his picture.
The survey, conducted March 10-April 6 among 3,147 adults who are part of the Pew Research Center’s American Trends Panel, also finds a large majority are able to associate a photograph of Kim Jong-un with the country he leads. Shown a picture of Kim Jong-un, 82% say he leads North Korea (from a list that includes South Korea, China and Malaysia).
The survey was conducted in the weeks leading up to the April 15 tax deadline: 84% know that in order to comply with the health care law, they must indicate on their taxes that they have health insurance coverage. The other choices given for demonstrating health coverage were when people vote, change their address, or get a driver’s license.
