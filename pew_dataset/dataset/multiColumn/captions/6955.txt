About two-thirds of Americans (65%) say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news about the economy. Thatâ€™s up six points from early December. About three-in-ten (29%) say they are hearing mostly bad news, not much different from the 33% that said this in early December. Just 5% say they are hearing mostly good news about the economy, about the same as the 7% that said the same last month.
