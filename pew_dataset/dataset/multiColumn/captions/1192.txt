Americans say they have very little understanding of current data protection laws, and most are in favor of more government regulation. Just 3% of U.S. adults say they have “a lot” of understanding of the current laws and regulations in place to protect their data privacy, with 63% saying they understand very little or not at all. However, the majority of Americans support more government regulation in this area. Some 75% of U.S. adults say there should be more government regulation of what companies can do with customers’ personal information. These numbers echo figures from an earlier Pew Research Center phone survey from 2013, not based on the American Trends Panel, which found that 68% of internet users believed the current laws weren’t good enough at protecting people’s privacy online.
