As was true in 2008, a plurality of partisan online political users gravitate towards news that shares their own political point of view
In the 2008 presidential election, we found for the first time that online political users were more likely to say that they typically got online political news from sites that shared their point of view, as opposed to sites that don’t have a particular point of view.3 This trend continued in 2010, as 34% of online political users said that most of the political news and information they get online comes from sites that share their point of view—compared with 30% who typically get news from sites that don’t have a point of view, and 21% who get news from sites that differ from their own point of view. As we found in 2008, views on this subject are correlated with partisan identification—both Republicans and Democrats were more likely than political independents to say that they typically get online political news from sources that share their political point of view.
