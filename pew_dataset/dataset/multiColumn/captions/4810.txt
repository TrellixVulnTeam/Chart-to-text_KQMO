At a time when China’s economic presence is growing in Europe, roughly half of young Europeans (a median of 52%) ages 18 to 33 have a positive view of the People’s Republic. But that view is tempered by their opinions about China when it comes to human rights.
Roughly six-in-ten French (61%) and British (59%) Millennials have favorable views of China, but that outlook is not shared by young Italians (28%) or Germans (30%). (In contrast, 44% of Americans ages 18 to 33 give China a thumbs-up.)
However, young Europeans are quite critical of Beijing’s human rights record. A median of just 17% across the seven countries surveyed believe that China respects the personal freedoms of its people. This includes just 6% of German and 7% of Italian Millennials. Notably, however, 25% of the British ages 18 to 33 say China respects civil liberties, in contrast with just 11% of British ages 50 and older who agree.
