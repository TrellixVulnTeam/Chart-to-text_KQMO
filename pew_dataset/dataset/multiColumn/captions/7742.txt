The current poll reflects unprecedented levels of partisanship with respect to evaluations of the president’s performance. As has been the case since Bush first took office, Republicans are solidly behind him, with 85% approving and just 11% disapproving of the job he is doing. But for the first time, Democrats are nearly as unified in opposition to Bush. Just 13% of Democrats approve of the president’s job performance, while 79% disapprove. Prior to this year, Democratic approval of Bush had never dipped below 23%.
Equally important, recent surveys have found Bush’s job approval among independents to be at an all-time low. In the current survey, as well as three other surveys conducted in late March and April, more independents disapprove of the president’s performance in office (49% currently) than approve (40%).
