The Pew Research Center’s early-April survey found that the public’s spending priorities vary greatly depending on the specific issue. At that time, more prioritized spending to make health care more accessible and affordable over reducing the budget deficit by a 59%-to-35% margin, and a majority also prioritized increased education spending over deficit reduction by about the same margin. But when it came to spending more to develop new energy technology, opinion was divided more evenly, with 49% prioritizing energy spending and 45% deficit reduction.
