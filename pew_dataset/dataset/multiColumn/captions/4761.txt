Among those ages 16 and older, 40% of Latinos say this, compared with 26% of whites and 32% of blacks. But here, too, the difference is driven entirely by foreign-born Latinos, half of whom say library closings would have a major impact on themselves and their families, while U.S.-born Latinosâ€™ response is much more like the rest of the population (29% say that the closing of their local public library would have a major impact on their family).
When it comes to the impact the closing of their local public library would have on their community, two-thirds (65%) of Hispanics say the impact would be a major one, a similar share to that of whites (63%) and blacks (64%). However, immigrant Hispanics are the most likely to see an impact on their community. Some 73% say this, compared with 58% of U.S.-born Hispanics.
