From mid-November until Republican Scott Brown won the Jan. 19 special election in Massachusetts to replace Ted Kennedy in U.S. Senate, majorities had said they thought health care legislation would pass in the next year. Immediately after the election, the percentage saying that dropped from 57% to 27%. It had been inching up since mid-February, but took a big jump last week – from 43% to 55% – as House Democrats appeared to have a majority of votes in reach to pass the Senate bill and a package of fixes.
