Certain segments of the population, though, diverge on what they tie to the issue of made-up news and information, with some of the most notable differences occurring along party lines. As previous research has shown, Republicans and Democrats hardly see eye to eye in their views of the news media and President Trump â€“ a split that extends to how often members of each party connect these actors to made-up news.
Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say the news media comes to mind when thinking of made-up news: 23% of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents say this, compared with 15% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, an 8-percentage-point difference. Among those who mention a specific news outlet, Republicans are more likely to mention CNN (6% vs. less than 1%) while Democrats are more likely to mention Fox News (7% vs. 1%). On the flip side, Democrats are about twice as likely as Republicans to name Trump or his administration (16% vs. 7%, respectively).
