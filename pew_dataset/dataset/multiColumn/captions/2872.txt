These shifts are particularly pronounced among ideological partisans. In 2015, liberal Democrats and Democratic leaners were divided in their assessments of whether their side was losing more (44%) or winning more (46%). Today, fully 81% of liberal Democrats say they are losing more, while just 12% say they are winning.
