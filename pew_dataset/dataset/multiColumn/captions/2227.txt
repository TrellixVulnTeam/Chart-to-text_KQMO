Western Europeans are divided over the impact of immigration on their nation’s culture, security and economy, particularly along ideological lines. For example, a third or more in each country surveyed say immigrants increase the risk of terrorism in their nation, with Germans and Italians the most likely to express this view. Within each country, left-right ideology tends to influence these opinions more than populist views do. People on the right are at least 20 percentage points more likely than those on the left to say immigrants increase the risk of terrorism in their country. Still, in most countries, populist views also matter – the populist groups studied tend to be more negative toward immigrants on the security issue than their mainstream counterparts are.
