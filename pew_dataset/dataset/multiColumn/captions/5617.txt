Not surprisingly, economic inequality is a common concern for publics around the world, according to a Pew Research Center survey of 39 nations. Most people agree that the economic system favors the wealthy. Majorities in most countries say the gap between the rich and the poor has increased in the past five years. This attitude is particularly prevalent among those who live in advanced economies. And at least half the publics in most countries say the wealth gap is a very big problem in their nation, with developing economies expressing especially high levels of anxiety.
