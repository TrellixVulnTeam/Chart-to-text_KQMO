In all regions of the world, Putinâ€™s image fares quite poorly compared with public perception of U.S. President Barack Obama. Three-quarters of Europeans have confidence in Obama to do the right thing in world affairs. Only 15% have such faith in Putin. By more than two-to-one, publics in Africa, Asia and Latin America trust Obama more than Putin. Only in the Middle East is confidence in Putin even close to confidence in Obama. And that is not because support for Putin is very high (25%), but rather because support for Obama is also quite low (36%).
