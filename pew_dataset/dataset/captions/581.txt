Older people in the UK are more likely to support reclaiming some powers from the EU. Almost three-quarters of British over the age of 50 take this position, compared with only 51% of those ages 18-35.
Britons with less education are more likely than those with more education to favor Brussels returning some powers to national capitals (68% vs. 56%). And men are more likely than women to prefer this option.
