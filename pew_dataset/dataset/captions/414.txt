More Millennial households are in poverty than households headed by any other generation. In 2016, an estimated 5.3 million of the nearly 17 million U.S. households living in poverty were headed by a Millennial, compared with 4.2 million headed by a Gen Xer and 5.0 million headed by a Baby Boomer. The relatively high number of Millennial households in poverty partly reflects the fact that the poverty rate among households headed by a young adult has been rising over the past half century while dramatically declining among households headed by those 65 and older. In addition, Millennials are more racially and ethnically diverse than the other adult generations, and a greater share of Millennial households are headed by minorities, who tend to have higher poverty rates. Millennial heads of households are also more likely to be unmarried, which is associated with higher poverty.
About half of cohabiting-couple households are headed by a Millennial. Since 2011, Millennials have headed more households made up of unmarried partners than any other adult generation. By 2016, Millennials were heads of 4.2 million of an estimated 8.3 million cohabiting-couple households. The greater prevalence of cohabitation among Millennial households partly reflects that Millennials are more likely to live with a romantic partner than earlier generations of young adults. For example, in 2012, among women ages 25 to 29 who were living with a spouse or partner, 37% were cohabiting. By comparison, in 1987 – when Boomers were at a comparable age to Millennials – just 10% of 25- to 29-year-old women in a union were cohabiting.
