Iran is not only the world’s fifth-biggest petroleum producer (about 4.1 million barrels a day) and 12th-biggest exporter (1.3 million barrels a day), it also has the world’s fourth-largest stock of proven crude oil reserves: 158.4 billion barrels, trailing only Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and Canada. Despite its oil wealth, Iran’s economy has been turbulent for much of the past decade. It’s real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product fell in three of the four years from 2012 to 2015, grew by 12.5% in 2016 and is projected to have fallen back dramatically since then.
