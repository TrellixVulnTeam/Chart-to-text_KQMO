Even as NASA’s mission in the world of space exploration has changed, its spending has been relatively flat over the past few decades (accounting for inflation). NASA spent $17.1 billion in fiscal 2014, which accounted for 0.5% of all federal government spending – or about one-ninth of the Department of Agriculture’s checks. As a share of the federal government’s outlays, NASA dropped from more than 4% in the mid-1960s to about 1% of what the U.S. spent in the early 1990s.
