While a Pew Research Survey last month found 67% of Americans believe there is solid evidence of global warming and 44% of them blame it on human activity, a global survey of 39 nations last spring found that 40% of Americans regarded global climate change as a major threat to the U.S.
By contrast, a median of 54% or more of publics in Canada, Europe, the Asia Pacific, Latin America and Africa saw global warming as a major threat to their countries. Concern was highest in Latin America (65%) and the Asian Pacific (56%). An opening statement at the Warsaw climate conference took particular note of the deadly typhoon that this weekend left many part of the Philippines devastated. Nearly two-thirds in the Philippines (66%) said climate change was a top concern in the spring survey.
The only region in the spring survey where public concern about climate change as a danger was as low as in the U.S. was the Middle East (42%).
