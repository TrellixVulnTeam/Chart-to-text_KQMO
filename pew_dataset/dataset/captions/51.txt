NATO recommends member states commit 2% of their gross domestic product to defense spending, a guideline that has been in place since 2006. But just 10 of the 29 member states for which data is available spend 2% or more on defense. (Data is not included for Iceland, which has no permanent military force.)
The U.S. is the leading defense spender among member states, committing an estimated 3.87% of GDP to defense expenditures in 2020. Nine other countries – including several in Central and Eastern Europe – also meet NATO’s 2% threshold. Just one country – Luxembourg – spends less than 1% of GDP on defense.
