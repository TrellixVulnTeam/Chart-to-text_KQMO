What’s behind the shift? While the increased total number of GOP Catholics in the House can be partially explained by the Republicans’ steady gain of seats during the last three elections, the share of GOP members who identify as Catholic also has grown from the 111th Congress (21%) to the 114th (28%). Meanwhile, the percentage of Catholics among House Democrats has dropped slightly, from 38% to 36%, over that same time period.
