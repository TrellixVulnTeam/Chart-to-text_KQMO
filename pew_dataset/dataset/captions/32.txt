Data from the past 50 years reveal the upward yet uneven trajectory of black political leadership in America. In 1965, there were no blacks in the U.S. Senate, nor were there any black governors. And only six members of the House of Representatives were black. As of 2019, there is greater representation in some areas – 52 House members are black, putting the share of black House members (12%) on par with the share of blacks in the U.S. population overall for the first time in history. But in other areas, there has been little change (there are three black senators and no black governors).
The current 116th Congress includes 52 black representatives, a record high and a large increase since 1965. (Rep. Adriano Espaillat, a New York Democrat and the first Dominican American elected to Congress, self-identifies as a Latino of African descent. The “Biographical Directory of the United States Congress,” on which this analysis is based, does not count Espaillat among the black members of Congress.) Only one of these 52 representatives – Will Hurd of Texas – is a Republican. Two nonvoting delegates, representing the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands, are black. Only six representatives were black in 1965, and all were Democrats.
