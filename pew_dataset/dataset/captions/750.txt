In January, there were 1.8 unemployed people per open position, according to the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (or JOLTS) and jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. While that may sound disheartening, it’s actually well within pre-recession norms: Between January 2005 and December 2007, the number of unemployed people per opening varied between 1.45 and 2.17, and averaged 1.68 over the entire three-year period.
But once the recession turned from ordinary into “Great,” the unemployed-to-openings ratio soared – peaking at 6.8 in July 2009, a month after the recession’s official end. It’s been trending downward since then as employers have stepped up hiring.
