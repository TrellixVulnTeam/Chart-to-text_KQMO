Terrorism is an issue that garners acute concern from more than half the populace (53%). Crime, however, is less of an issue in Russia than in previous years, with only 39% saying it is a very serious problem. In 2017, 52% said it was a top concern, which was already significantly lower than the three-quarters of Russians who were very concerned in 2002.
