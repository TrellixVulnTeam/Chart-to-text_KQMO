In 2013, overall digital display advertising accounted for $17.7 billion, up from $14.8 in 2012. But five major technology companies—Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and AOL—accounted for 51% of that nearly $18 billion in revenue in 2013. That share is up substantially from 38% in 2009 and it edged up slightly from 2012 (50%).
Facebook has sprinted past Google to become the biggest player in the digital display ad market, bringing in $3.17 billion in revenue in 2013 compared with $2.99 billion for Google. As recently as 2009, Facebook controlled only 7% of the digital display market.
