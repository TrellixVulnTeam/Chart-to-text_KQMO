Gallup’s annual economy and finance survey, conducted in April, found 52% of Americans saying they owned stock, either directly or through a mutual fund, retirement account or other investment vehicle. The ownership share dropped sharply after the 2007-08 financial crisis and has continued falling throughout the nation’s wobbly recovery. (A Pew Research Center survey conducted in March found a somewhat lower ownership share — only 45% of Americans in that survey said they had money in the market.)
