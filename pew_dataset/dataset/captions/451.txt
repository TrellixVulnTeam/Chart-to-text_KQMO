Millennials – whether living with their parents or not – are moving significantly less often than earlier generations of young adults. Among 25- to 35-year-old Millennials who were living at home in 2016, 91% reported that they resided at the same address one year earlier. This does not preclude the possibility that the young adult moved out and “boomeranged” back in the intervening year (perhaps multiple times); the data simply indicate that they lived with their parent or parents one year earlier as well.
