As for median household income, the most recent data we have is for 2011 (the Census Bureau will release 2012 numbers next week), but they show that after factoring in inflation, the median U.S. household income shrank 4.7 percent between 2008 and 2011. Little surprise, then, that more than half (54%) of the people in our survey said household incomes have hardly recovered since the recession, and a scant 2% said theyâ€™ve fully recovered.
