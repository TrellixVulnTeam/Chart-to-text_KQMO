About half of Americans (49%) say the slow pace in evaluating the safety and effectiveness of medical treatments is a big problem. Some 46% say a big problem is that health care providers are too quick to order potentially unnecessary tests and procedures, 44% cite new treatments being made available before we fully understand their effects and 42% say new treatments are so complex that patients cannot make informed decisions.
