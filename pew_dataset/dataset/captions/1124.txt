According to Pew Research Center estimates, the share of all foreign-born legal permanent residents who have become naturalized U.S. citizens rose to 56% in 2011, the highest level in three decades and an 18 percentage point increase since 1990. That represents a population of 15.5 million naturalized citizens, an increase reflecting both a rise in the annual inflow of legal migrants and an increased likelihood that those who are eligible to apply for citizenship actually do so.
