The largest differences are by party, and they are especially significant. CPC supporters (72%) are far more likely to favor building the pipeline, compared with only 45% of Liberals and an even smaller share of NDP followers (22%). The NDP won provincial elections in Alberta in May and opposes construction of the pipeline. However, Albertans do not share the NDPâ€™s opinion. Nearly two-thirds (65%) in Alberta favor building the pipeline through their oil sands region, while only 38% support it in Ontario and British Columbia and 31% in Quebec.
