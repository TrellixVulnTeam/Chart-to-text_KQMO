About three-in-ten online adults (31%) posted a video to a website in 2013, up from 14% in 2009, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center report. Among those who posted a video in 2013, 35% said they did so in hopes that it would be widely viewed or “go viral.” Overall, 72% of online adults use video-sharing sites like YouTube or Vimeo – a figure that more than doubled between 2006 and 2013.
