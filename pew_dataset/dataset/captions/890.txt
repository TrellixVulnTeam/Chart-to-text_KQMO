If Baquet is an historic figure at the Times, he is also part of a small minority at U.S. news outlets. Our data analysis finds that in newspaper newsrooms, the percentage of overall staffers and supervisors who are black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American or multiracial has remained virtually unchanged in the past two decades—accounting for about one in every 10 positions. The situation is slightly different in broadcast news, where minority staffers are still vastly outnumbered, but their presence has, in some cases, risen modestly.
According to the 2012 newspaper newsroom census from the American Society of News Editors (the latest available data), minorities account for 12% of the workforce. That represents virtually no change since 1994, when minorities represented 11% of newsroom employees and a decline from the high point of 14% in 2005. (The percentage of women in newsrooms has also remained unchanged—at around 35%—since the late 1990s.)
