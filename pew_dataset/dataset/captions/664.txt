This comparison of hundreds of individual survey questions, with and without the offline population, found that for most of the topics studied by Pew Research Center, the size of the bias caused by excluding the non-Web respondents is quite small. Across 406 separate survey items, only nine yielded estimates that differed by 5 or more percentage points. More than two-thirds of the 406 items yielded estimates with a 0 or 1 point difference. This is a consequence of the fact that the non-Web survey group is a small share of the total population, as well as the fact that the size of the differences between the Web and non-Web groups tends to be relatively modest on most questions.
