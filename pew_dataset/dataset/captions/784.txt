About three-in-ten (29%) say they were following news about the terrorist shootings in Paris very closely, according to a separate survey conducted Jan. 8-11 among 1,000 adults. That compares with 24% who were very closely following news about the U.S. economy, 19% who tracked the AirAsia flight that crashed Dec. 29, and 17% who paid close attention to news about the incoming Republican leaders in Congress.
While younger Americans typically pay less attention to news events than older Americans, the gap on the terrorist shootings in Paris is particularly large: 43% of those ages 65 and older followed this news very closely, while just 15% of those ages 18-29 say they did the same.
