The health care debate has been among the more closely followed stories since the middle of last August, when many lawmakers held at-times raucous town hall meetings with constituents about the legislative proposals. About half (49%) said they were following these stories very closely the week of Aug. 21-24, 2009. For much of the second half of the year, the health care debate ranked as either the top or second most closely followed story of each week.
