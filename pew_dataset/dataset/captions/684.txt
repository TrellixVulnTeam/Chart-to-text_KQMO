The Daily Show attracts a much younger news consumer than cable and network news shows. The median age of Web-using adults who got news from The Daily Show was 36 years last year, similar to that of its then-companion show, The Colbert Report (33 years). This is much younger than for other television news shows, both on cable and broadcast networks, including the network evening news programs and cable news shows like Oâ€™Reilly, Anderson Cooper 360 and the Rachel Maddow Show.
