News about the economy is the week’s top story. Nearly four-in-ten (37%) followed news about the condition of the economy very closely, which is on par with interest in the economy for the past several months. An increasing percentage said the news they are hearing about the economy is mostly bad; 37% say that currently, the highest percentage this year. (For more see “Perceptions of Economic News Turn More Negative,” June 5, 2012.)
Nearly three-in-ten (29%) say they are following news about the presidential candidates very closely, which also is little changed from the past few months. And while there is scant public interest in news about Europe’s economic problems and political violence in Syria, interest in the conclusion of the John Edwards trial also attracted little interest. Just 13% say they followed news about the Edwards verdict very closely. Edwards was acquitted on one campaign fraud charge, while the jury deadlocked on five other charges.
