We measure overall wireless connectivity in two ways. One way is by asking users if they connect through wireless cards in their laptops. Most people of all ages who own laptops now do this. The more striking difference appears in the second aspect of wireless internet use â€“ through mobile phones. College students are much more likely than the overall cell owner population to use the internet on their mobile phones, although all young adults do this at a relatively high rate regardless of student status.
