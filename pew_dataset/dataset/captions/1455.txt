This chart shows estimates of the unauthorized migrant population as of March 2004 subdivided by when the migrants arrived in the United States.
About 30% of the unauthorized population in 2004 or 3.1 million persons arrived in the 4+ years since 2000. In the 5 years before that, 3.6 million arrived. Thus, about two-thirds of unauthorized migrants have been in the country less than 10 years.
