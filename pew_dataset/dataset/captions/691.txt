As the United States formally re-establishes diplomatic ties with Cuba, a new Pew Research Center survey shows that people in Latin American nations approve of this action and support the U.S. ending its long-standing trade embargo against the island nation. And many Latin Americans surveyed say they expect that Cuba will become more democratic over the next several years. However, overall views of Cuba across the six countries are mixed, and there is little confidence in Cuban President Raul Castroâ€™s ability to handle international affairs.
Across the Latin American countries surveyed, there is robust approval for the U.S. re-establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba. Overall, a median of 77% across five Latin American countries share this view.
