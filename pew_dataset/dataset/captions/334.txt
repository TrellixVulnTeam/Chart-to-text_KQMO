Another sign of the importance of the Bible to African Americans is their participation in prayer and scripture study groups. (Our question did not distinguish between the two types of groups.) Across religions, black people in the U.S. are more likely to take part in prayer or scripture study groups at least weekly (39%) than are whites (22%) and Hispanics (27%). And people in the historically black Protestant tradition are as likely to do this (44%) as those in the evangelical tradition (44%) and more likely to do this than are Catholics (17%) and mainline Protestants (19%). They are less likely to participate in prayer and scripture study groups weekly than are Mormons (71%) and Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses (85%).
