Pakistanis are also more willing to support the army in its fight against terrorist groups in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas than they were in the past. In 2015, 58% supported using the army to fight these groups, with only 16% opposed. Comparable levels of commitment to rooting our terrorists in these areas have not been seen since 2009, when the question was first asked.
