An overwhelming majority of black Americans see the treatment of racial and ethnic minorities as a key issue to their vote in 2016. Fully 82% of blacks overall say this issue is very important, and it is among the highest on this groupâ€™s 2016 agenda.
Nearly three-quarters of Hispanic voters (72%) also say the treatment of racial and ethnic minorities is a very important issue to their decision in the fall. Both blacks and Hispanics are more likely than white voters to say this issue is very important to their vote, though a 56% majority of white Americans do say the same.
