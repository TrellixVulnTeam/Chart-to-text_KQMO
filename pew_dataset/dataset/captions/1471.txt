President Bush is facing an electorate that is almost as focused on the economy as it was in the fall of 1991, when rising economic concern began to unravel his fatherâ€™s reelection chances. In an open-ended format, nearly half (49%) of Americans volunteer the economy or jobs as the single issues they most want the presidential candidates to discuss. That is considerably higher than levels measured at various points during the last two presidential campaigns and is nearly as high as in October 1991 (58%), although more Americans focused on jobs at that time than now.
