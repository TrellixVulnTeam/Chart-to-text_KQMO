As Table One and Chart One show, the presidential and national party campaign organizations accounted for 93% of the estimated ad spending detected through the Evaliant software in the first seven months of 2004: Kerry for President (49.5%), the Republican National Committee (18.3%), Bush for President (15.7%), and the Democratic National Committee (9.7%). The 527s have largely ignored online advertising. (As of the first week in September, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth had not run any online ads.)
