The latest national survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press, conducted Jan. 4-8 among 1,507 adults, including 549 Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters, finds that Mitt Romney holds a sizable lead in the race for the GOP nomination: 27% favor Romney, while Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich are tied for second with 16% each. Ron Paul is not far behind at 12%.
Despite Santorumâ€™s strong showing in the Iowa caucuses, where he only lost to Romney by eight votes, Romney has been the most visible GOP candidate in recent days. In a separate survey conducted Jan. 5-8, 44% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters name Romney as the candidate they have heard the most about recently, compared with 16% who name Santorum and 12% Gingrich.
