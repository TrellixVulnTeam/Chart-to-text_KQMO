Just 1% (six members) of the current 114th Congress immigrated into the U.S. at some point in their lives, compared with about 10% (nine of 95) who were born abroad in the first Congress of 1789-91, which was a much smaller Congress, and 8% (31 of 407) during the next peak, the 50th Congress of 1887-89, amid the broader U.S. immigration wave from Europe.
