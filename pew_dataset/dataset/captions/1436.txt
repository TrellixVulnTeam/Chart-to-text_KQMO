Way back in 1994, when few Americans had even heard of the internet, most people still walked to their bank’s nearest branch to do whatever check cashing or bill paying they couldn’t do at the corner store or by mail. When a survey by the Pew Center for the People & the Press asked the principal bill-payer in each household, “Do you ever do ‘electronic banking’ from home—that is, use a computer or the telephone to pay bills or move money from one account to another?” fewer than one in ten (9%) among this group said yes, they had done such a transaction. By 1995, that figure had risen to 13% of bill-payers. In 1998, when the Pew Research Center switched to asking all internet users if they ever paid bills or banked online, 13% of this larger group, or about 10 million American adults, said yes.
By 2000, when the Pew Internet & American Life Project fielded our first survey, the proportion of internet users who said they ever did any banking online had risen to 17% or about 16 million Americans. Over the next few years, internet users ramped up a range of online financial and transactional activities, trusting more and more of their personal financial information to the Web. Among categories of activities, online banking and online auctions grew the most rapidly, especially among men, home broadband users, and internet users under the age of 50.
