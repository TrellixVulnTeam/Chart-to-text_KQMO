As the economy has soured, many Latinos are adjusting their economic behaviors. More than seven-in-ten (71%) report that they have cut back spending on eating out. Two-thirds (67%) say they planned to curtail holiday spending. More than one-fourth (28%) report that they helped a family member or friend with a loan.
The National Survey of Latinos 2008, Economics and Politics, focuses on Hispanic adultsâ€™ views of the state of the economy, their own personal finances and housing market conditions. It also asks about the sending of remittances in the past year and how Latinos have changed their economic behaviors in the economic downturn. The survey was conducted from November 11 through November 30, 2008, among a randomly selected, nationally representative sample of 1,540 Hispanic adults. The survey was conducted in both English and Spanish. The margin of error for the full sample is plus or minus 3.0 percentage points.
