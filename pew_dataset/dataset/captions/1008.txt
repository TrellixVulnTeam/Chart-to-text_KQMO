The current controversy is bringing international attention to the role of women in Saudi society, but more broadly the kingdom has a poor reputation globally for how it treats its citizens. In a spring 2013 survey, a median of only 18% across 39 countries said that the government of Saudi Arabia respects the personal freedoms of its people. This compares with a median of 70% who say the U.S. respects human rights, and 36% who believe the same about China. Saudi Arabia does score higher in this regard than Iran, but few publics have a high opinion about either governmentâ€™s treatment of their own people.
