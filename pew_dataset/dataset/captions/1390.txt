Nearly nine-in-ten Americans know that China was the source of dangerous toys and tainted food recently in the news. And sizeable majorities can identify House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and the Sunni as the branch of Islam struggling with the Shia for control in Iraq. But fewer can identify Robert Gates’ position in the administration, the approximate level of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, or the Hispanic candidate in the Democratic Party’s presidential race.
Americans also were tested on their knowledge about several people in the news. Roughly three-quarters (74%) could identify the current speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives as Nancy Pelosi. Somewhat surprisingly, more Republicans than Democrats knew this (81% among Republicans, 72% among Democrats).
