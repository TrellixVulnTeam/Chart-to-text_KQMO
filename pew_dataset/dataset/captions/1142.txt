The Pew Hispanic survey also explored the reasons Hispanic immigrants who are legal permanent residents havenâ€™t yet tried to become citizens. According to the survey, when asked in an open-ended question why they had not naturalized thus far, 45% identified either personal barriers (26%), such as a lack of English proficiency, or administrative barriers (18%), such as the financial cost of naturalization.
