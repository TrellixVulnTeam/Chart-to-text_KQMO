Many Americans say NATO does too little to solve global problems. In an October 2017 Pew Research Center survey, almost half of Americans (48%) said NATO does not do enough to help solve world problems. About a third (31%) said NATO does the right amount, while just 5% said the alliance does too much to solve the worldâ€™s problems.
