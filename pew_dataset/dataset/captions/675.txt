Among the issues tested, rising prices is the top concern. Just over three-quarters (76%) say inflation is a very big problem.
Seven-in-ten or more also name crime, unemployment, corrupt political leaders, drug cartel-related violence and corrupt police officers as very big issues.
Half or more say poor-quality schools, health care and people leaving Mexico for jobs in other countries are very big concerns.
However, less than half name the gap between rich and poor, immigrants traveling through Mexico from Central America to the U.S., or traffic as top worries.
