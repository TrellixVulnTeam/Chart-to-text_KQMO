With the Democratic convention and McCain’s surprising choice for a vice presidential running mate, public interest in the campaign increased dramatically. Following the convention, fully 45% were paying very close attention to news about the campaign. This is up from just 31% who said they were tracking news about the candidates very closely a week before the convention. Some 44% named the campaign as their most closely followed story of the week – making it by far the public’s top news interest.
