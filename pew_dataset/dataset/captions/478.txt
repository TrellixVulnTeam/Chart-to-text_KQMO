The story around mobile security is not all negative. Very few smartphone owners (3%) say they never update their phone’s apps or operating system or use a screen lock to access their phone. And some users are especially diligent when it comes to mobile security, taking the steps most recommended by cybersecurity experts. Around one-in-five smartphone owners (22%), for example, say they use a screen lock for their phone, update their apps either automatically or as soon as an update is available, and immediately update their device’s operating system when a new version is offered.
But most users (75%) fall in the middle of the mobile security spectrum. This group includes smartphone owners who use a screen lock but, unlike more diligent users, only update their phone’s apps and operating system when it’s convenient for them to do so.
