Independents stand out from partisans in several important ways. They are less politically engaged than Republicans or Democrats â€“ and this is especially the case among independents who do not lean to a party.
In a survey conducted last fall, shortly after the midterm elections, partisan leaners were less likely than partisans to say they registered to vote and voted in the congressional elections. About half of Democratic-leaning independents (48%) said they voted, compared with 59% of Democrats. The differences were comparable between GOP leaners (54% said they voted) and Republicans (61%).
