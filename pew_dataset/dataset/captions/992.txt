Americans like their turkey, but their appetite has limits. After rising rapidly in the 1980s, per-capita turkey consumption leveled off at nearly 18 pounds per year, but more recently has been drifting lower. Last year, according to Agriculture Department data, Americans ate an average of 16.03 pounds of turkey. At this yearâ€™s projected consumption level (5.06 billion pounds), per-capita consumption likely will be about the same or a bit lower than 2012.
