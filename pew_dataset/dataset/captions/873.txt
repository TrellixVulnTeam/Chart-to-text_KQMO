Newspapers have more journalists in statehouses than other media do, accounting for 43% of the full-time reporters. But those ranks have been thinning. An examination of comparable newspaper data from 2003 to 2014 finds that the number of full-time statehouse reporters dropped by 35% between 2003 and 2014â€”a loss of 164 jobs. A number of observers say this has led to diminished coverage.
