These online announcements, however, are still very much in the minority. Since the 2004 election cycle, 27 of the 41 candidates who appeared in the Republican or Democratic presidential primary debates (or have announced for 2016) included a public address in their formal announcement, according to our calculations. (Sometimes, candidates have also made the announcement on some other platform, as in 2003 when former Sen. John Edwards, a North Carolina Democrat, announced on The Daily Show before giving a formal speech.)
In that election cycle, twice as many Republican candidates (eight) made their announcements through a TV or radio appearance than did through formal speeches (four). And this was not simply “dark horse” candidates looking for a gimmick: former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani announced on Larry King Live, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee announced on NBC’s Meet the Press. Two GOP contenders launched their campaigns on late-night comedy shows that cycle: Sen. John McCain of Arizona confirmed his run on Late Show with David Letterman, and Thompson followed up an online video with an announcement on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.
