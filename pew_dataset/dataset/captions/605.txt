Some portions of the social-media public are more likely to engage in this activity than others. Liberals outpace both moderates and conservatives, with about a quarter (26%) of liberal social media users having changed their pictures in response to an issue or event, compared with 14% of conservatives and 16% of moderates. This rises to three-in-ten liberals ages 18-49. These differences hold even when accounting for age, sex, and race and ethnicity.
Differences also emerge around gender, race and ethnicity, and age. Specifically, female social media users are more likely to change their profile pictures than men, as are black social media users compared with whites and Hispanics. About one-in-five of users ages 18-29 and 30-49 did so, compared with 13% of 50- to 64-year-olds and just 5% of those 65 and older.
