For people who do have online access, social networking is popular nearly everywhere, but especially in the emerging world. For example, nearly nine-in-ten online Jordanians, Indonesians, Filipinos and Venezuelans report using social networks. This compares with only 57% of online French, 54% of online South Koreans and half of online Germans. This also means that among internet users, social networking is more popular in the Middle East and Latin America than it is in the U.S. and Europe.
Internet access is strongly tied to per-capita national income. Richer countries in the survey tend to have higher rates of internet access or smartphone ownership compared with poorer nations. This also holds true when emerging and developing nations are compared with each other. While there is a strong correlation in this relationship, as middle-income countries approach total internet saturation it is likely that this association will diminish.
