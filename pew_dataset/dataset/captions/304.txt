Regardless of whether they hope to see a female president, a majority of Americans (68%) say they expect there to be one in their lifetime. That number is down slightly since 2014, when 73% of the public said they thought the U.S. would elect a female president in their lifetime. Still, the share who say they think this is likely to happen is higher than in 1996, when the question was first asked. At that time, only about half of Americans (54%) said they thought they would see a woman as president in their lifetime.
