While Chicago’s murder rate is far from the highest in the nation, it has led the U.S. in murder totals each year since 2012. Since 1985, only two other cities have held this distinction: New York and Los Angeles, which are also the only two American cities with larger populations than Chicago’s.
Chicago’s annual murder total reached its highest level in two decades in 2016 (765 murders), but New York, Los Angeles and several other big cities have enjoyed long-term declines. No decrease has been more dramatic than New York’s: The 292 murders that took place in the Big Apple in 2017 were down from a peak of 2,245 in 1990. In fact, New York’s murder rate – 3.4 homicides per 100,000 people – is now below the national average.
