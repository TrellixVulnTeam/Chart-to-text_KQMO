Five specific, self-identified radio formats accounted for 69% of the 1,536 LPFM stations, four of which are religious in nature (“religion,” “Christian,” “religious music” and “Spanish/religious,” according to data from BIA/Kelsey). The most common format named was “variety” (476 stations) – which spanned such organizations as the Gourd Farming Educational Society, Northland College, and the African American Family and Cultural Center. Other format categories included “information” (36 stations), “oldies” (31), “alternative” (29), “country” (15) and “ethnic” (10). Many stations offer a mix of locally originated programs with syndicated shows.
