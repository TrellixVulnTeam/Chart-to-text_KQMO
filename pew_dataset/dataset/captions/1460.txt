This chart shows the proportion of workers who are unauthorized migrants in a selection among the CPS’ 27 “detailed occupation groups”. The major occupations shown are those where the proportion of unauthorized migrants exceeds the proportion in the workforce (4.3%).
This chart shows the distribution of unauthorized migrants across industries by combinations of the CPS’ 14 “major industry groups” for those migrants who are in the labor force. The specific groups shown are those where the distribution of unauthorized workers approximates or exceeds the distribution of natives.
The concentration of unauthorized workers in broad industries is not as marked as the concentration in broad occupation groups. Only in “leisure & hospitality” and in “construction” does the share of unauthorized workers greatly exceed the share of natives. Somewhat greater than 1 in 6 unauthorized workers is in the the leisure & hospitality industry (18%) or the construction industry (17%). Only about 7%–8% of native workers is in each of these industries. Neither of these industries tends to require credentials from prospective workers. Further, there are many occupations in these industries that do not require much in the way of education.
