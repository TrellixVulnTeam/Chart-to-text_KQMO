The number of Americans hearing mostly bad news about the economy has fallen 12 points over the past month and 31 points since fears of a new recession intensified in August.
Currently, 56% say the news they are hearing about the economy is a mix of good and bad, while 36% say the news is mostly bad. This is the first time since May that significantly more view news about the economy as mixed than mostly bad. As has been the case for the past three years, very few people (6% currently) say the news they are hearing about the economy is mostly good.
Despite the improving perceptions of economic news, however, somewhat more say they are hearing mostly bad economic news today than did so at the start of the year (24% in January).
