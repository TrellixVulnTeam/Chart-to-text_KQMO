Certain religious groups stick out as particular targets of restrictions and hostilities. For example, there has been a marked increase in the number of countries in which Jews were harassed. Jews, who make up just 0.2% of the world’s total population, were harassed either by governments or social groups in 77 countries in 2013, up from 71 in 2012 and 51 in 2007. As in previous years, the world’s two largest religious groups faced harassment in the largest number of countries: Christians were harassed in 102 countries, and Muslims in 99.
