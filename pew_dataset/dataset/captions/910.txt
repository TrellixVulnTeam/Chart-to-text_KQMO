1 A third (34%) of Americans liked or loved doing their taxes, according to the survey we conducted at this time last year. Of course, that left 56% who didn’t like the annual exercise including 26% who hated doing their taxes. Among those who liked doing taxes, the largest share said it was to get a refund followed by those who said they didn’t mind or prided themselves for being good at. The IRS says the average refund so far this year is $2,792.
