Americans also are using less water in their homes, which indirectly addresses climate change. (As the EPA notes, “It takes lots of energy to pump, treat, and heat water, so saving water reduces greenhouse gas emissions.”) According to our analysis of data from the U.S. Geological Survey, average residential water use was 87.5 gallons per person per day in 2010 (the latest year for which data are available). That’s nearly 21% below the average use figure for 1980, the peak year.
