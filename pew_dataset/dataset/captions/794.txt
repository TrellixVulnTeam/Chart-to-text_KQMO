Even among Catholics, the two groups espouse very different views on some church teachings. For instance, Mexican Catholics are significantly less likely than Mexican-American Catholics to say the Catholic Church should allow priests to marry and women to be ordained as priests.
Indeed, just 31% of Mexican Catholics favor changes to church policy on the priesthood â€“ that is, allowing priests to marry or women to become priests. By contrast, about half or more of Mexican-American Catholics say that priests should have the option to marry, and that the priesthood should be open to women.
Mexican-American Catholics who were born in the U.S. are especially likely to support changes to the priesthood, with about two-thirds saying that priests should be able to marry and women should be able to become priests. Whether or not these levels of support for change among the American-born reflect the impact of acculturation, these percentages are roughly comparable to the corresponding shares of U.S. Catholics overall who favor these changes (72% and 68%, respectively).
