As views of overall economic news have become less negative, perceptions of news from economic sectors have improved as well. Following a week of large stock market gains, about as many say they are hearing mixed news about financial markets (43%) as say they are hearing mostly bad news (38%). Last month, more said the news was mostly bad rather than mixed (by 50% to 41%). In August, more than twice as many were hearing mostly bad news than mixed news (69% vs. 25%).
With the November federal jobs report showing a drop in the unemployment rate from 9% to 8.6%, fewer also are hearing mostly bad news about the job situation. Still, about half (51%) say recent news about jobs has been mostly bad; 37% say they are hearing a mix of good and bad news and 10% report hearing mostly good news. The percentage saying they are hearing mostly bad news about jobs has declined 13 points since last month and 23 points since August.
