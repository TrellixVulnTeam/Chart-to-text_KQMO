The new data show that 4.32 million adults (ages 18 or older) were newlywed in 2012, a 3% percent increase over the 4.21 million adults newly married in 2011. (The data do not include same-sex couples.)
But a closer look at the demographic patterns reveals some interesting insights about who is getting married. From 2011 to 2012, the total number of newly married adults increased by 113,000 (from 4.21 million to 4.32 million). Examining the newlyweds by education level, the number of newly married adults with at least a bachelorâ€™s degree increased by 98,000 from 2011 to 2012. Thus, almost the entire increase in new marriages (87%) from 2011 to 2012 is accounted for by the college-educated.
