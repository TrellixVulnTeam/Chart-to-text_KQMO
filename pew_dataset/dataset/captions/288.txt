Overall, around 5 million U.S.-born children younger than 18 were living with at least one unauthorized immigrant parent in 2016, up from around 4.5 million in 2007, according to the new estimates. The number of U.S.-born children has leveled off in recent years, reflecting the decline in births and the decrease in the unauthorized immigrant population since the Great Recession.
