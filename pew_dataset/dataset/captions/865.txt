For the second week in a row, news about the fighting between Israel and Hamas is near the top of the publicâ€™s news interest list. About three-in-ten (31%) say they were very closely following reports about the fighting in Gaza.
Nearly as many (28%) say they very closely followed news about Central American children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border; a week ago, 33% followed this story very closely.
And in the wake of new U.S. and European Union sanctions against Russia, 24% say they followed news about the situation involving Russia and Ukraine. News about the U.S. economy attracted a similar level of attention (27% following very closely).
