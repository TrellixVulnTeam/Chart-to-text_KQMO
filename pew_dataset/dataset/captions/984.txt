Amid rising tensions in East Asia, a new report finds that while relatively few Chinese (12%) regard the United States as an enemy, about four-in-ten Chinese (41%) see the U.S. military presence in East Asia as a major threat to their country and an even greater number (63%) see the U.S. as the nation posing the greatest threat to China.
In addition to the general public, the survey also examined the views of five elite groups: government officials, journalists, business leaders, military scholars, and non-military scholars. Majorities in four of these five groups described the American military presence in East Asia as a major threat (non-military scholars were the lone exception).
