In fact, water will boil at about 202 degrees in Denver, due to the lower air pressure at such high elevations. In Pew Research Centerâ€™s recent survey on science knowledge, only 34% of Americans knew that water boils at a lower temperature in the Mile High City than in Los Angeles, which is close to sea level. This was the question in our quiz that the fewest people answered correctly: 26% said they thought water would boil at a higher temperature in Denver, while 39% said it would boil at the same temperature in both places.
