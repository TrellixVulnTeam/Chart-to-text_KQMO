National search interest for gun models tends to increase during the holiday shopping season. In each year from 2012 through 2017, weekly Google search activity for gun models rose an average of 20% during the week of Thanksgiving and 14% during the week of Christmas, relative to one week prior. (Weekly search data are only available after 2012.) The FBIâ€™s background check data show a similar trend: Black Friday, for example, has set a single-day record for gun background checks in each of the past three years.
