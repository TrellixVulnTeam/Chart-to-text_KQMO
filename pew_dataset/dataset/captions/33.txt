The share of blacks serving in a presidential Cabinet was at or above parity with the population during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. But there was only one black Cabinet secretary during Obama’s first term, and the same is true so far in Donald Trump’s administration.
The highest level of black representation in a presidential Cabinet occurred during Bill Clinton’s first term, when four out of 15 Cabinet appointees were black. Throughout the rest of Clinton’s administration and George W. Bush’s two terms, the share remained high relative to the share of blacks in the U.S. population overall. When Obama took office, he appointed only one Cabinet member who was black – Attorney General Eric Holder. During Obama’s second term, there were four black Cabinet appointees. The only black Cabinet member to have been appointed by Trump so far in his presidency is Ben Carson, secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
