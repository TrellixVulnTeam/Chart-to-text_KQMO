The upcoming midterm elections might be underwhelming for many Americans, but it could shape up to be one of the most profitable for local TV stations – one of the sources Americans turn to most for news about politics. Local TV has been receiving the largest portion of political media spending for at least a decade, but the share it consumes and the total dollars reaped continue to grow.
Through mid-October, local TV stations have captured 95% of the television political ad spending, which includes spot, national cable, national network broadcast (local cable political ad spending is not part of this analysis). In 2012, during the last presidential elections, local TV stations captured 92% of total political TV ad spending, based on the same analysis.
From January to mid-October 2014, total political ad spending for local TV was about $1.3 billion, according to a Television Bureau of Advertising (TVB) analysis of Kantar CMAG data. Those dollars, though, are far from evenly distributed across the states. More than half of that has gone to 10 states with the most competitive races (Florida, California, Texas, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Georgia, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and New York). In Florida, a state with a closely-watched governor’s race pitting incumbent Rick Scott against former Republican-now Democrat Charlie Crist, the political ad spending has topped $100 million dollars, the highest among all states.
