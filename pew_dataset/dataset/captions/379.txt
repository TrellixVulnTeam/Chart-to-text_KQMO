The survey also asked Americans who say they do not use voice assistants about their reasons for not using them. Some 61% of these non-users say they are just not interested in the tool. Around one-quarter of this group say they do not use voice assistants because none of the devices they own have this feature (28%) or because they are concerned about privacy (27%). And a slightly smaller share (18%) reports that voice assistants are too complicated to use.
