When it comes to top concerns in Venezuela, the list of problems is long and daunting. The foremost issue, and one that has plagued the country for years, is inflation. Roughly nine-in-ten (92%) say that rising prices are a very big problem. Inflation in Venezuela is the highest in the world, and is estimated to be well over 100%. The next most concerning issues are also economic â€“ lack of job opportunities (85% very big problem) and shortages of basic goods (84%). The lack of basic goods is partially on account of the high inflation rate.
Other serious issues also rank high among Venezuelans: Roughly seven-in-ten or more say that crime, public debt, health care, corrupt political leaders and poor quality schools are very big problems. In fact, worries about health care and poor quality schools have increased in just the past year (up 15 and 14 percentage points, respectively). Many people also say that inequality (56%) and traffic (51%) are significant problems, with intense concerns about traffic increasing 13 points since 2014.
