Item: Isolationism – American willingness to involve the country in world affairs rose in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. In December 2002, just 30% of the public expressed the view that the United States should “mind its own business internationally.” Since then, isolationist sentiment has risen substantially reaching levels last seen during the mid-1970s, following the Vietnam War, and in the mid-1990s after the Cold War ended. In a November 2005 Pew/Council on Foreign Relations survey, about 42% of the U.S. public ascribed to the “mind its own business” view – a percentage that remained unchanged a year later in Pew’s December 2006 poll.
