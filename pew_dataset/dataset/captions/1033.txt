About 550,000 men were stay-at-home dads in the past decade. Together they comprised about 3.5% of all married couples with children where at least one spouse had a paid full-time job. That’s about double the number in the 1970s when roughly 280,000 men—about 2% of the total—stayed home with the kids, and the number of full-time caregiving dads is expected to continue to increase, according to an analysis of government data by a research team headed by University of Illinois sociologist Karen Z. Kramer.
