Americans are also closely divided over whether transgender people should be able to use public restrooms that correspond to their current gender identity. Roughly half of all adults (51%) say transgender people should be able to use the restroom that matches the gender with which they currently identify, while 46% say they should be required to use the restroom of their birth gender. In addition, young adults – those ages 18-29 – are far more likely than their elders to take the position that transgender people should be allowed to use restrooms that correspond to their current gender identify.
Two-thirds (67%) of Americans say employers should be required to provide birth control to employees through their health insurance plans, even if the business owner has religious objections to contraception. Weekly churchgoers, however, are more evenly split on this issue; about half (46%) say business owners should have a right to decline coverage of contraception based on religious beliefs.
