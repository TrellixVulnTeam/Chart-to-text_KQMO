In 2016, Millennials for the first time surpassed all other generations in number of household heads who were single mothers. Last year, 8.6 million households were headed by a single mother who lived with a child younger than 18. About 4 million of these mothers were Millennials, slightly outnumbering the 3.9 million Gen Xers heading single-mother households. Baby Boomers who were single mothers with young children and heading a household numbered only 0.6 million. The incidence of single parenthood has increased markedly since 1980. That year, 19% of children lived in a single-parent family; by 2014, 34% did.
