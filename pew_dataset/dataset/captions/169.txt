But that “insta-narrative” turned out to be oversimplified. The 2016 election was not, in fact, an industry-wide failure for the polls.2 Rigorous national surveys – designed to measure the popular vote rather than capture the effects of the Electoral College – were quite accurate by historical standards. An average of the final, publicly released national polls suggested that Hillary Clinton would win the overall popular vote by 3 percentage points, and she ultimately won by 2 points.
