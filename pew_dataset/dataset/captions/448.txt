In 2004, the five largest companies in local TV – Sinclair, Nexstar, Gray, Tegna and Tribune – owned, operated or serviced 179 full-power stations, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission filings data. That number grew to 378 in 2014 and to 443 in 2016. If approved by regulators, Sinclair’s acquisition of Tribune would bring its total to 208, by far the largest among the media companies.
In 2016, the five biggest local TV companies’ total broadcasting revenue was $8.3 billion, or 30% higher than in 2014, the previous major election year. And political advertising revenue grew by 31% during this two-year period. (Retransmission fee numbers are not reported separately for all five companies, though data for the industry overall show that this type of revenue has also been increasing rapidly.) Since 2004, these companies have more than doubled their broadcasting revenues, while their political advertising revenue has tripled.
