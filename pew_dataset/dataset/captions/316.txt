NATO recommends that member countries commit 2% of their gross domestic product to defense expenditures. Yet just four out of 28 member countries meet this threshold. The U.S. dedicates the greatest share of its GDP to defense spending (3.57%), followed by Greece (2.36%), the UK (2.12%) and Estonia (2.08%). At the other end of the spectrum, Slovenia, Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg all dedicate less than 1% of their GDP to defense.
