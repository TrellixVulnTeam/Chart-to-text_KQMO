Immigrants and their U.S.-born offspring accounted for 55% of the increase in population since 1966-67.3 Within this group of 55 million, Latino immigrants and their offspring were by far the largest, representing about 29 million persons, or 53% of the addition due to immigration, according to the Centerâ€™s estimates.
About 12 million Asian and Pacific Islander immigrants and their offspring were added to the population, representing about 22% of the increase due to immigration. The white immigrant population and its offspring increased by approximately 10 million (18%) while the black immigrant population and its offspring increased by almost four million (7%).
That trend prevailed among all racial and ethnic groups. Of the 29 million Latinos added due to post-1966 immigration, 17 million were immigrants and 12 million were their U.S.-born offspring, according to the Pew estimates. Among whites, about 6 million were immigrants and 4 million were their offspring. Among blacks, 3 million were immigrants and 1 million were their offspring. And among Asian and Pacific Islanders, about 9 million were immigrants and 3 million were their offspring.
