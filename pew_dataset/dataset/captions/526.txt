Overall, 69% of Latino registered voters say they are “absolutely certain” they will vote this November, down modestly from 77% who said the same in 2012. Among the sharpest declines – 13 percentage points – is among Millennial Latinos. This year, 62% say they are absolutely certain they will vote compared with 74% who said the same four years ago.
Yet, even though a lower share of Latino registered voters say they are certain to vote than in 2012, engagement with the election is roughly similar. Two-thirds (67%) say they have given “quite a lot of thought” to it in 2016, while in 2012, 61% said the same.
