A search of the LexisNexis database of 15 of the nationâ€™s largest newspapers from Jan. 1-Sept. 27, 2013, identified 335 stories that talked about the 2016 campaign. That is more than double the coverage the 2012 campaign received (132 stories) during the first nine months in 2009. One reason for lighter coverage four years ago was that the 2012 election featured an incumbent president with no significant challengers within his party, so attention was focused almost solely on the Republican side.
