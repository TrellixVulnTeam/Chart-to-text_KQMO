A related trend is the sharp rise in news coverage of the stock market, which reflects this growing public interest in such news. An analysis of Wall Street coverage since 1990 by selected news organizations (CBS Evening News, Newsweek and The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer) shows that through 1996, these outlets covered an average of about 100 stories on the stock market each year (aside from brief market updates). The number rose dramatically to well over 200 per year beginning in 1997. Although the market has always generated news when it boomed or crashed (such as in 1987 or 1998), the high level of coverage since 1997 has persisted. The trend is evident in both print and broadcast media.
