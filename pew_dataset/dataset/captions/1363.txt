Three main election themes dominated the coverage. The end of the presidential campaign — which encompassed coverage on just two days, was the No. 1 story, accounting for 27% of the week’s newshole. Coverage of the election results — including straight reporting and analysis — was No. 2, filling another 21%. And coverage of the incoming Obama administration — which began on Nov. 5 and looked forward — was right behind, also accounting for 21% of the newshole.
