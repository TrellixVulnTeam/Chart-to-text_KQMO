U.S. births are in the news again, with the release today of 2012 statistics indicating a flattening of the sharp decline in fertility that accompanied the Great Recession. The number of U.S. births in 2012 was not statistically different from 2011, and the birth rate barely declined, according to the National Center for Health Statistics.
Here are the preliminary numbers: There were 3,952,937 babies born in the U.S., no different statistically from the 3,953,590 born the year before. The fertility rate was 63.0 births per 1,000 women of childbearing age, only slightly lower than 63.2 in 2011, which itself had been the lowest on record.
