This chart shows the distribution of unauthorized migrants across occupations by combinations of the CPS’ 10 “major occupation groups” for those migrants who are in the labor force. (The distribution of native workers is shown in parentheses.)
Unauthorized migrants account for about 4.3% of the civilian labor force or about 6.3 million workers out of a labor force of 146 million. ([Note that these data are not adjusted for persons omitted from the CPS. Were they corrected for omissions,the number of unauthorized migrants in the labor force would probably be about 675,000–700,000.) Although the unauthorized workers can be found throughout the workforce, they tend to be over-represented in certain occupations and industries. The next several charts attempt to identify some of these concentrations.
Unauthorized workers are conspicuously sparse in white collar occupations compared with native. “Management, business, and professional occupations” and “Sales and administrative support occupations” account for over half of native workers (52%) but less than one-quarter of unauthorized workers (23%). On the other hand, unauthorized migrants are much more likely to be in broad occupation groups that require little education or do not have licensing requirements. The share of unauthorized who work in agricultural occupations and construction and extractive occupations is about three times the share of native workers in these types of jobs.
