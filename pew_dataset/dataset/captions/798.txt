A previous program may offer some insights. One way immigrants may qualify for relief is under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which started in 2012 and is now expanding. In that program, applications surged after the programâ€™s launch and trailed off over time. Today, nearly two-thirds (64%) of the estimated 1.1 million unauthorized immigrants who are eligible have had their applications accepted for review.
DACA offers deportation relief and work authorization to those who came to the U.S. as children. So far, about 702,000 unauthorized immigrants have had their applications accepted for review since the program began in August 2012, according to recently released U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data showing program applications, approvals and renewals through Sept. 30, 2014. Of the applicants, 87% have been approved for the renewable two-year permits.
