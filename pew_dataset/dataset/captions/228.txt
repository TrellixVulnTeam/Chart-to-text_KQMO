Young adults and part-time workers are especially likely to have been personally affected by workforce automation. In 2017, 13% of those ages 18 to 24 had either lost a job or had pay or hours reduced because their employers replaced their positions with a machine, robot or computer program. That compares with slightly smaller shares of those ages 30 and older. Those employed part time were also slightly more likely than those employed full time (11% vs. 5%) to cite these personal impacts from automation.
