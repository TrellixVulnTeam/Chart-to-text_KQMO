Supreme Court justices tend to come from similar backgrounds. Seven of the eight current Supreme Court justices, for example, previously served as federal appeals court judges. (Only Elena Kagan did not.) When looking at 112 current or former justices, the vast majority had prior experience in private legal practice, according to a Pew Research Center analysis in March 2017. More than half had previously served as judges on either federal or state courts or held elected office.
