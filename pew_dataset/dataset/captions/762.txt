There were just over 5 million job openings on the last business day of 2014 (after adjusting for seasonal variations), according to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (known as JOLTS), which is produced by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. While that was little changed from Novemberâ€™s level, it was the highest figure since January 2001, just before the dot-com bust. While job openings have been increasing since the latter part of 2009, the pace accelerated markedly last year.
