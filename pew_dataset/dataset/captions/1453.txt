The chart sub-divides the foreign-born population in 2004 according to estimates of legal status.
In 2004, naturalized citizens represent just under one-third of the foreign-born population at 11.3 million or 32% of the 35.7 million estimated total. Legal permanent resident aliens (LPRs or “legal immigrants”) who have not yet become citizens represent about 10.4 million or about 29% of all immigrants living in the country. A substantial share of the foreign-born population (just over 10 million or 29%) is unauthorized (either entering clandestinely without inspection, with fraudulent documents, or overstaying visas), and a smaller share (2.5 million or 7%) is made up of refugees2 (immigrants who fled persecution). Another 3-5% of foreign-born residents are “legal nonimmigrants,” temporary visitors such as students and temporary workers.
