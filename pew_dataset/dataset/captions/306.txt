Despite satisfaction with the countryâ€™s overall direction, the Russian public still sees a bevy of problems. Among these, economic issues are the most pressing, especially inflation: 69% say rising prices are a very big problem for Russia. An additional 25% say inflation is a moderately big problem, meaning that 94% of the public is concerned about the issue. Other economic issues near the top in the survey are income inequality and a lack of jobs, with 57% of Russians saying these are very big problems. Inequality, in particular, is considered a bigger problem among Russians ages 50 and older (66% say it is a very big problem) and those whose income is below the country median (62%).
Corruption among the political elite is also a pressing concern among Russians, with 59% saying it is a very big problem. Concern about corruption is especially common among people who lack confidence in Putin (of whom 69% see it as very big problem) or do not support United Russia (67%). Fewer Russians are concerned about corrupt business leaders (44%).
