According to a Pew Research Center survey in 2012, a majority (77%) of all registered voters support photo ID laws, including 71% of Latino registered voters. The survey also found an overwhelming majority (97%) of Latinos said they were confident that they had the identification necessary to vote. That compares with 98% of all registered voters who said the same ahead of the 2012 presidential elections.
