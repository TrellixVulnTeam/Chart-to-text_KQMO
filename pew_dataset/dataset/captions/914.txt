While internet access is lagging in India, cell phone usage is much more prevalent, with 77% of the population owning a mobile device. About half of Indians who own a cell phone use them to send text messages, but only 37% use the devices to take pictures or video. Even smaller shares of mobile phone owners use the devices to access a social networking site (9%) or to get political news and information (8%). These figures are well below the median percentages that we found in other emerging and developing countries.
