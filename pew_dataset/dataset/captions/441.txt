Even though the Senate first allowed cloture to be sought on nominations in 1949, it wasnâ€™t until the 1968 nomination of Abe Fortas to be chief justice of the Supreme Court that it was actually attempted. The cloture vote failed, and Fortas was not confirmed. Over the next two decades, cloture was sought only 10 times on nominations and was actually invoked eight times, primarily for judicial positions, according to a Congressional Research Service report. But since 1992, according to Pew Research Center tabulations of Senate data, 232 individual nominees have been subject to at least one cloture vote.
