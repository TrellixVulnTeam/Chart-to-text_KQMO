Of all major racial/ethnic groups, Latinos have the lowest rates of health insurance coverage. Access to health care is strongly influenced by the options available. Hispanics often work for employers who do not provide coverage. At the same time, disparities are not as large among the elderly because of Medicareâ€™s wide coverage. In 2000, 34 percent of Hispanics under the age of 65 lacked any type of health insurance coverage, compared with 11 percent of non-Hispanic whites. Lack of health insurance varies widely by national origin group and place of birth. One- fifth of native-born Latinos lack coverage, compared with a quarter of foreign-born Latinos who have naturalized, and nearly 55 percent of foreign-born Latinos who do not have U.S. citizenship. Low rates of insurance among Latinos may contribute to the fact that Hispanics are less likely than whites to use health services for preventive care.
