Our July blog post struck a chord with many Americans exhausted by the amount of election coverage. At the time, the November election was still about four months away, yet most Americans told us they were already worn out by election news. This feeling of fatigue was particularly true among those who weren’t following news about the election very closely – 69% of this group said they were worn out compared with about 41% of those who were following the election very closely.
When asked about various topics of campaign coverage, two areas stood out for being over-covered: About four-in-ten said there was too much coverage of candidates’ comments on the campaign trail and of their personal lives, higher than any other topics asked about. There was only one topic that most Americans said had received too little coverage – candidates’ stances on issues.
