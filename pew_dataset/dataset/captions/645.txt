Among the issues tested, rising prices, crime and the gap between rich and poor are seen as the biggest problems in Turkey. Lack of employment opportunities (51% saying it is a very big problem) is also seen as a major issue.
There are lower levels of concern over corruption among political leaders, poor-quality schools, traffic and health care. But overall, most Turks still see these issues as at least moderately big problems.
