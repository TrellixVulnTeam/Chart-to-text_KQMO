The American public is evenly divided on whether the increased number of deportations of undocumented immigrants in recent years is a good thing or a bad thing (45% each), according to a recent Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults. About half of whites (49%) view the growing number of deportations positively. But Hispanics have a different view. By 60% to 35%, Hispanics view the increase negatively, according to the survey.
