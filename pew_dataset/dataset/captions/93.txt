Among those who say they have not participated, 70% say they or someone else in their household definitely or probably will respond to the census, and 26% say they definitely or probably will not.
About seven-in-ten adults say they think the 2020 census will be very successful (8%) or somewhat successful (60%) in accurately counting the number of people living in the U.S., according to the Centerâ€™s new survey. An additional 31% say the census will be not too successful (26%) or not at all successful (5%) in doing so. In an earlier Pew Research Center survey, conducted in late February and early March, 75% said the census would be somewhat or very successful, and 24% said it would not be.
