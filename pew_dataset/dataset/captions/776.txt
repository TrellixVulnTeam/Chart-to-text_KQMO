There were 11.2 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. as of 2012.
The total number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. has not changed since 2009, standing at 11. 2 million in 2012. (A preliminary Pew Research estimate put the 2013 population of unauthorized immigrants at 11.3 million, statistically unchanged from the 2012 figure.) Before then, the unauthorized immigration population had risen rapidly, from 3.5 million in 1990 to a peak of 12.2 million in 2007, the year that the Great Recession began. Another major trend has been the decline in the number of unauthorized immigrants from Mexico, falling to 5.9 million in 2012 from a peak of 6.9 million in 2007.
