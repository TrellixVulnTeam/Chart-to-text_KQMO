After entering Europe, most new arrivals apply for asylum. Asylum seekers are given medicine, shelter and food by local and national governments while they wait for their applications to be processed. To date, more than 2 million first-time applications have been received by EU member countries, Norway and Switzerland since January 2015, far more than any previous wave of asylum seekers since the years following World War II.
The 2015 surge of asylum seekers continues to strain European governments. Since November 2015, the number of pending applications has exceeded 1 million among EU countries, Norway and Switzerland, and could take another year to clear.
Not all asylum seekers have their applications for refugee status approved. Between January 2015 and June 2016, applications from about 500,000 of them were rejected. These asylum seekers can appeal the decision, request a temporary extension of their stay in Europe on humanitarian grounds or leave Europe. Rejected asylum applicants can also be ordered to leave the country or deported to either their country of citizenship or the first European country they entered.
