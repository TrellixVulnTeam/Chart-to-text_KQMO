The survey also asks people about whether voting this year will be easy or difficult. A large majority (84%) of those who plan to vote in the midterms say voting will be easy, though fewer than half (44%) say they expect it will be very easy. About one-in-seven people (15%) who plan to vote say it will be difficult.
