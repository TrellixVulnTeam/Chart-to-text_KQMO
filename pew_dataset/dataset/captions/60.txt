Looking at the various combinations of responses to those questions, this survey finds that 48% of Americans would be relatively comfortable or likely to engage with all three of those steps, and 51% would be relatively resistant to at least one core aspect of the process. In making this calculation, we used a somewhat generous definition of engagement. (The percentages who actually would cooperate could be higher or lower.) The 48% referred to in most of this report as “comfortable or likely to engage” with all steps are those who say they would do all of the following in the coronavirus contact tracing process:
In addition, younger adults, Hispanic adults, those with lower incomes and those with less formal education are less likely to be fully comfortable or likely to engage with the process than their counterparts. About four-in-ten adults ages 18 to 29 (41%) say they would be comfortable or likely to engage with all three steps, compared with 56% of those ages 65 and older. And while White and Black adults are similarly likely to fall into this group given their responses – about half of each group expresses full comfort or likelihood engaging – Hispanic adults are less likely to say this (four-in-ten Hispanic adults say so).
