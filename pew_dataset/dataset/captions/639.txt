The most important change in telephone surveys in the past decade has been the adoption of dual frame survey designs that include cellphone numbers. Many survey organizations now conduct at least as many interviews by cellphone as by landline in national surveys. As of 2015, the typical Pew Research Center poll interviews 65% of its respondents on cellphones and 35% on landlines. The cellphone share has grown over time as the share of the population using only a cellphone has risen.
