Viewers tend to turn to The Daily Show primarily for entertainment, rather than in-depth reporting or the latest headlines. Many prominent public figures have been guests on the show, ranging from Academy Award winners, musicians and authors to Supreme Court justices, U.S. presidents, vice presidents and first ladies. Still, the most commonly cited reason viewers watch The Daily Show is for its entertainment value. A 2010 Pew Research Center study on Americansâ€™ news media habits found that 43% of regular Daily Show viewers said they mainly turn to the show for entertainment, compared with 24% who said they watch for views and opinions, 10% for the latest headlines and just 2% for in-depth reporting (20% gave some mix or all of the reasons).
