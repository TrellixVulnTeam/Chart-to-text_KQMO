The publicâ€™s appetite for presidential campaign news reached an all time high last week as Obama and McCain faced off in their third and final debate. Fully, 61% of Americans reported following news about the campaign very closely and another three-in-ten (28%) were following the race fairly closely. The campaign attracted significantly more attention than the previous week, when roughly half (52%) followed election news very closely.
The level of public interest in the campaign for mid-October is significantly higher than at the same point in 2004 (56% now vs. 46% then). An analysis comparing the last two News Interest Index surveys (conducted Oct. 10-13 and Oct. 17-20) with results from mid-October 2004 finds that interest in the campaign is up among many subgroups. There is much higher interest this year among African Americans (up 24 points), those with a high school degree or less education (up 18 points), Democrats (up 17 points) and those 65 years and older (up 16 points). Meanwhile, the percent of Republicans following campaign news very closely is the same (57%) as it was at this point in 2004.
