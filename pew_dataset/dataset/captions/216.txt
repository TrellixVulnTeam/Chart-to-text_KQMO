Mexico has apprehended and deported more migrants within its borders so far this fiscal year than at the same point in fiscal 2018, though the totals remain well below levels recorded in other recent years, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from Mexico’s office for population and immigration statistics.
Mexican authorities apprehended nearly 92,000 migrants in the first seven months of fiscal 2019, up 32% from the same period the previous year. Still, this year’s total remains below the 141,000 apprehensions made during the same period in fiscal 2006 (when the U.S. also experienced a surge of non-Mexican immigrant apprehensions at the southern border). It’s also far below the number of southern border apprehensions made by the U.S. government during the first seven months of fiscal 2019.
