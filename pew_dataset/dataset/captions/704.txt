The Great Recession played an important role in reversing a rise in the number of U.S. births, which peaked at 4.3 million in 2007. Both total births and the birth rate declined each year from 2008 to 2013, but rose in 2014, according to preliminary data. Historically, births have declined during economically hard times and risen again when the economy recovers.
The birth rate — that is, number of births per 1,000 women in the traditional childbearing ages of 15 to 44 — grew to 62.9, from 62.5 in 2013. The rate generally rose for older women, and declined or held steady for women younger than age 30. The teen birth rate, generally declining since the 1990s, fell to a historic low.
