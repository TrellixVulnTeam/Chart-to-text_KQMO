The Supreme Court’s pair of decisions on same-sex marriage was the public’s top news story of the week. Three-in-ten (30%) very closely followed the coverage of these rulings. Fewer (19%) followed the court’s decision on the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
Relative to other major Supreme Court decisions of the last four years, news about the rulings on same-sex marriage attracted about as much interest as the 2012 decision on Arizona’s immigration law (29% very closely), but attracted far less attention than the court’s judgment to uphold most provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In June 2012, 45% of the public followed this story very closely. Public interest in the court’s decision to overturn parts of the Voting Rights Act ranks in the middle of the pack among major court decisions since 2009.
