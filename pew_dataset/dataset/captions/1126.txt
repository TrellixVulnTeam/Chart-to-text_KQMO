A survey in March found that 71% of Americans say there should be a way for people in the United States illegally to remain in this country if they meet certain requirements, while 27% say they should not be allowed to stay legally.
But there is a division of views among the 71% who support finding a way for immigrants here illegally to stay.
Roughly four-in-ten (43%) of the public says unauthorized immigrants should be allowed to apply for citizenship, but 24% of the public says they should only be allowed to apply for legal residency.
