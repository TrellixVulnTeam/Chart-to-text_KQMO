Facebook is the revenue leader in display advertising, the area of digital advertising from which news organizations make most of their online revenue and where the social networking giant gets nearly all of its revenue. Display advertising – a format that includes banners and video ads – brought in $5.3 billion for Facebook in 2014, eMarketer estimates. That amounts to almost a quarter of the total U.S. display ad market ($22.2 billion) and represents even stronger year-over-year growth than in 2013.
At the heart of Instant Articles is the mobile market, which has grown increasingly important as more people become smartphone owners, reading news and performing other tasks where advertisers can reach them. Indeed, mobile ad revenue grew 78% in 2014, to$19 billion, and was 37% of all digital ad revenue, according to eMarketer data. As with general display advertising, Facebook is the leader in mobile display, and by a larger margin. In 2014, the company took in more than one-third ($3.5 billion) of the $9.6 billion mobile display ad market. And these revenues continue to grow as a share of Facebook’s digital ad revenue, accounting for about two-thirds in 2014. (The company’s most recent earnings report puts mobile at around 73% of Facebook’s total ad revenue in the first quarter of 2015.)
