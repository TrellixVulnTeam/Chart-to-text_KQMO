As for sources of health information, about seven in 10 Latinos (71 percent) report that they received information from a doctor in the past year. An equal proportion report obtaining health information through their social networks, including family, friends, churches, and community groups. An even larger share (83 percent) report that they obtained health information from some branch of the media, with television being the dominant source.
Not only are most Latinos obtaining information from media sources, but a sizeable proportion (79 percent) say they are acting on this information. It is beyond the scope of this report to assess the accuracy and usefulness of health information obtained from non-medical sources, but the survey findings clearly demonstrate the power and potential of these alternative outlets to disseminate health information to the disparate segments of the Latino population.
