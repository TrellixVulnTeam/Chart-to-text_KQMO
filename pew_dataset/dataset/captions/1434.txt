Education, the economy and health care are the leading concerns for voters this year – roughly eight-in-ten say each is very important to them personally. By contrast, many of the issues that have recently gotten attention – either on Capitol Hill or in the media – rank among the least important to voters. Barely a third (34%) say the issue of gay marriage is very important, and only somewhat more rank abortion, global warming, ending the inheritance tax, and government surveillance programs as very important. While gay marriage is more important to Republican voters than Democratic voters, even here it comes far down the list below such issues as terrorism and homeland security, the economy, and immigration.
