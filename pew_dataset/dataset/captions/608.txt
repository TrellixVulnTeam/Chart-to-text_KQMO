Twitter can be a valuable tool in helping to deal with emergencies. A 2012 Pew Research Center study found that Twitter was a critical lifeline when Hurricane Sandy devastated wide swaths of the East Coast in October of that year. Twitter traffic during Sandy and its aftermath was more than double what it was just before the storm hit; people mainly used Twitter to share news and information as well as photos and videos.
