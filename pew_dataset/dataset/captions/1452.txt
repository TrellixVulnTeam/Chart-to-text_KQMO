If debate about O’Connor’s replacement is not framed with respect to the repeal of Roe vs. Wade, it is likely to mostly attract the attention of strong Republican conservatives and liberal Democrats. Pew’s political typology survey found that nearly six-in-ten Enterprisers (59%) say the choice is very important personally, as do roughly half of Liberals (49%) and Social Conservatives (47%). Fewer than four-in-ten in the other typology groups attach great personal importance to the choice of the next Supreme Court justice (see “Beyond Red vs. Blue,” May 10, 2005).
