Whose job will it be to square that circle? Mainly the 80 million or so members of the Millennial generation, now anywhere from their teens to early 30s. That generation — currently the largest segment of the U.S. population — embodies the nation’s growing diversity: 43% of Millennials are non-white, the highest share of any generation. And while they’re much less trusting than their elders (only 19% say most people can be trusted, about half the level of Boomers), they’re also more optimistic about the future: 55% say that America’s best days are ahead of it, compared with 48% of Boomers.
