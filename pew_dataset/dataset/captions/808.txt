Rising pollution in the developing world – Once again, Asian respondents to the Global Agenda survey are more concerned about air pollution than other regions. But across 34 emerging and developing nations that we surveyed, including nine in Asia, a median of 54% see air pollution as a problem in their countries.
Growing importance of health in the economy – As developing nations grow, health care spending in those countries is also expected to increase. In fact, the most important problem facing the emerging and developing economies in our survey, after economic issues, corruption and crime, is health care. A median of 59% across 34 nations say it is a very big problem in their country.
