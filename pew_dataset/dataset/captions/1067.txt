Unlike the unemployment rate, which can be affected by how many jobless people actively look for work, the employment-to-population ratio (sometimes called the employment rate) looks at employed adults as a share of the total civilian noninstitutional population; examining just 25- to 54-year-olds takes out most students and retirees. Despite some recent improvement, the June employment rate of 75.9% is still well below pre-recession levels, which typically were close to or above 80%. And the flatness in the rate indicates the economy isnâ€™t doing much more than adding enough jobs to keep up with population growth.
