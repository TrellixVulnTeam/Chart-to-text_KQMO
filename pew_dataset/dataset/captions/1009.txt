In a March 2013 Pew Research Center survey, 75% of U.S. Catholics said that reforming the Vatican bureaucracy should be an important priority for Pope Francis. One-in-three Catholics (35%) said reform should be a “top priority;” while 40% said it was important but a “lower priority;” 13% said it is not too important or unnecessary.
