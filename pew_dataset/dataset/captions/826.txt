Before talk about a “triple dip recession” made headlines, Europeans have been overwhelmed with economic concerns and the growing gap between the rich and the poor is high on that list. Overall, a median of 32% across the seven EU nations surveyed name inequality as the top threat to the world. People in Spain and Greece, among the hardest hit by the Eurocrisis, are especially worried. In fact, worries about inequality have doubled in Spain since 2007, as well as in Italy, another economically damaged southern European country. While the British are also concerned about inequality, fears about religious and ethnic hatred are even more common in the United Kingdom (39% name it top threat).
