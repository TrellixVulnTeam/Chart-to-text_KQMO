A 2013 Pew Research survey showed that about half of Russian adults (53%) think Islamic extremist groups pose a major threat to their country. More Russians express concern about Islamic extremism than any other topic tested, including international financial instability and climate change. Among Muslims in the North Caucasus region, more than half say they are either very concerned (32%) or somewhat concerned (25%) about religious extremism in Russia.
