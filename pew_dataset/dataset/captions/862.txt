U.S. Census Bureau data show that 144,000 more people left the island for the mainland than the other way around from mid-2010 to 2013, a larger gap between emigrants and migrants than during the entire decades of the 1970s, 1980s or 1990s. This escalated loss of migrants fueled the islandâ€™s first sustained population decline in its history as a U.S. territory, even as the stateside Puerto Rican population grew briskly.
