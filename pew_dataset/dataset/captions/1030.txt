That’s especially true when it comes to the jobs situation. Nearly two-thirds (63%) of self-identified Republicans said jobs have “hardly recovered at all” from the recession (which began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research), compared with 44% of self-identified Democrats and half of independents. By contrast, 53% of Democrats and 46% of independents say employment has “partially recovered,” versus just over a third (35%) of Republicans. Both could be right, depending on which jobs measure you look at: While the unemployment rate has steadily improved for nearly four years, the employment-population ratio, which compares people with jobs to the entire working-age population, is up only slightly since its early-2011 low.
