While 37% of Americans plan to spend less on gifts this year, 10% plan on spending more. This yearâ€™s average Christmas shopper plans on spending $704, down from the $770 they planned to spend around this time last year, according to Gallup. Looking back to 1999, the largest amount that Americans planned to spend on Christmas gifts was $866 in 2007, before the nation was hit with the financial crisis. The smallest amount was $616 during the 2008 recession, a year later.
