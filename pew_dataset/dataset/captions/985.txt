Currently, 45 Fortune 1000 companies have women as their chief executives. There will be 46 women CEOs in that elite group as of January, when Barra takes the reins at GM, Jacqueline Hinman becomes CEO of engineering giant CH2M Hill and Linda Lang is scheduled to step down as chief of Jack in the Box.
That would represent an all-time high, according to data compiled by nonprofit research firm Catalyst. A decade ago, only 16 companies on Fortune’s list had women CEOs. Still, that’s less than 5% of the top jobs at America’s top corporations.
