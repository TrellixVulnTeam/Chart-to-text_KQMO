But public trust and confidence in government, while low, is no lower than it was in the summer. Currently, about three-in-ten (31%) say they can trust the government in Washington to do the right thing just about always, or most of the time. That is virtually unchanged from a Gallup survey in June (30%).
While Katrina has not further weakened the public’s trust in government, there nonetheless is a striking contrast between the public’s lackluster feelings about government and the strongly positive opinions seen in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. In October 2001, Gallup found 60% saying they could trust the government just about always or most of the time ­ the highest level recorded since 1968 in surveys conducted by the University of Michigan’s National Election Study.
