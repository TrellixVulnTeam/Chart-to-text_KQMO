Analysis of the survey shows that judgments of the way Bush is handling the situation in Iraq is a strong factor in attitudes toward his reelection, while opinions of the decision to go to war are not particularly crucial. This marks a significant change since mid-April, when opinion about the decision to go to war drove voting intentions more than views of the president’s handling of the war. The analysis also shows that the president’s approval rating on handling terrorism, which remain strong at 64%, is not as important a factor in attitudes toward his reelection.
