The survey finds that just 18% say they are satisfied with state of the nation â€“ the lowest percentage in two decades of People-Press polls. Reflecting the widespread unhappiness with the national economy, an overwhelming proportion of respondents say the economy (88%) and jobs (78%) will be very important in their vote. In addition, roughly three-quarters each name healthcare, education, energy and Social Security as very important.
