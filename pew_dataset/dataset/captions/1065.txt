In its early surveys about technology use in 2000, when about half of American adults used the internet, the Pew Research Centerâ€™s Internet Project found that about a tenth of those internet users placed phone calls using the internet. In its last reading in late 2012, when over 80% of Americans were internet users, the Project found that 30% of them had placed online phone calls.
