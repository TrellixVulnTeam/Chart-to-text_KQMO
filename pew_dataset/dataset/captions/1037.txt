People are more pessimistic about jobs and income, and with good reason. Fully 45% of respondents said the job situation has only partially recovered, and 52% said it’s hardly recovered at all. While the unemployment rate has declined steadily for nearly four years, that’s due in no small part to people simply leaving the labor force — taking early retirement, going back to graduate school, or simply giving up looking for work. The employment-population ratio, which compares people with jobs to the entire working-age population, is up only slightly since its early-2011 low. (The chart shows the ratio for people ages 25 to 54, to minimize the impact of students and retirees).
