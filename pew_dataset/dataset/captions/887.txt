The Census Bureau’s recent report on characteristics of newly built housing reveals lots of interesting regional variations, beyond the widely reported fact that median square footage of single-family homes has resumed its pre-housing crash climb.
For one, housing hasn’t grown evenly in all regions of the country. New homes are largest in the South, where the median floor area last year was 2,469 square feet; they’re smallest in the Midwest, at a median 2,177 square feet. (The median for the whole country is 2,384 square feet.) But over the past four decades, home size has grown the most in the Northeast: The median floor area of a new home there was 61% above the corresponding median in 1973.
