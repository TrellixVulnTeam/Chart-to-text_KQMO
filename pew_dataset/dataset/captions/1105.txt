Nearly one-third—31%—of people say they have deserted a particular news outlet because it no longer provides the news and information they had grown accustomed to, according to the survey of more than 2,000 U.S. adults in early 2013. And those most likely to have walked away are better educated, wealthier and older than those who did not. In other words, they are people who tend to be most prone to consume and pay for news. (In the survey, the “news outlet” was not confined to one segment of the media but could have been print, television, online or on other platforms).
