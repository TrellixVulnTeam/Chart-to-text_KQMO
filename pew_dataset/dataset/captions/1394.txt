The second element of the rural broadband gap is the relatively low level of broadband adoption among rural residents who do use the internet. Just over half (55%) of rural internet users have a broadband connection at home; among urban/suburban adults, broadband adoption among internet users is 73%. Suburban and urban residents are also more likely to have access to a broadband connection at their place of employment; just over two thirds of rural adults (38%) have access to a broadband connection either at home or at work, versus more than 55% for urban and suburban residents.
