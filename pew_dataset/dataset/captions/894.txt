But Europeans still think the EU doesnâ€™t listen, is out of touch, intrusive and inefficient. People across Europe overwhelmingly think that their voice is not heard in Brussels, home to the EU. Majorities in all seven countries surveyed think their voice does not count in the EU. Italians (81%) and Greeks (80%) are particularly disheartened and 71% of Germans share this sense of powerlessness. A median of 65% say the EU does not understand their needs, a median of 63% see the EU as intrusive, and a median of 57% hold the view that the EU is inefficient.
