Until recently, the U.S. government was paying historically low rates on its debt, largely because of the Federal Reserveâ€™s efforts to keep interest rates low during and after the Great Recession. But interest rates on federal debt have begun rising again. In fiscal 2018, the average interest rate on the public debt was 2.492%, compared with 2.232% in fiscal 2016, according to the Treasury Department. In June, the average interest rate had risen to 2.567%.
