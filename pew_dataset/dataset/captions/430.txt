The relatively young age at which rural gun owners first acquired a gun is perhaps not surprising: Americans who grew up in rural areas are more likely to have grown up with guns in their homes. About seven-in-ten Americans who grew up in a rural area (72%) say there were guns in their household growing up, compared with half (52%) of those who grew up in a small town and 39% of those who grew up in a city.
