More broadly, in a 2014 survey we asked online Indians what types of activities they use the internet for. Majorities of internet users said they had used the web to stay in touch with family and friends and to search and apply for jobs in the past 12 months. At the time, fewer than a quarter of online Indians said they were engaging in commerce or taking a class, but roughly a third or more were getting information about health, government services or politics online.
Indians don’t necessarily see the increasing influence of the internet in India as a good thing for the country. In a 2014 survey, only 31% of Indians said that the increasing use of the internet has had a good influence on politics, 32% said it was good for personal relationships and 37% said it was good for morality. Views of the internet’s influence on education were more positive, though: 57% of Indians say it has been good for education in their country.
