The 50,420 asylum applications Canada received in 2017 were more than double the 23,930 it received in 2016. Applications that meet basic eligibility requirements, such as having no serious criminal convictions, are referred to Canadaâ€™s Immigration and Refugee Board for further review; the vast majority of applications in 2017 received this referral.
