Approval of Turnbull’s handling of world affairs comes at a time when Australians are ambivalent about global engagement: About half say that Australia should deal with its own problems and let other countries deal with their own, while 45% say that Australia should help other countries.
When asked whether Australia should deal with its own problems and let other countries fend for themselves or help other countries deal with their problems, the public is almost evenly split. About half (49%) prefer to focus on their own country’s problems, while 45% say they want to help other countries. Australian sentiment is similar to that in the UK (where 43% say to help other countries), and a slightly larger share favors global engagement than in the U.S. (37% help others).
