Obama and his administration had been viewed positively by LGBT Americans even before this most recent expression of support for LGBT rights: The Pew Research Centerâ€™s survey of 1,197 LGBT adults, conducted this spring, found that Obama enjoyed significantly higher favorability ratings among LGBT adults than the general public. And according to the national exit polls, lesbian, gay and bisexual voters supported Obama 76% to 22% over Mitt Romney in the 2012 election.
In the same survey, Obama was mentioned most frequently when respondents were asked to name national public figures most responsible for advancing LGBT rights: About a quarter (23%) of LGBT adults volunteered Obama.
