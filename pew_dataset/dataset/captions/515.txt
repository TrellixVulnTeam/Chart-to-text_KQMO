Our survey asked those who have earned money through digital employment platforms – such as ride-hailing apps or various digital task sites – why they take on this type of work. They cited a number of reasons, from helping to fill in gaps in their other sources of income (37% mentioned this) to needing ways to earn money that could fit into the other demands on their time (30%). But the number one motivation, cited by 42% of respondents, was fun, or because the work gives them something to do in their spare time.
