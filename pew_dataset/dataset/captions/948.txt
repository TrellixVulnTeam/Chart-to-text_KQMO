Internet users in emerging countries are relatively advanced in their use of social media, compared with the U.S. Even though a smaller share of adults are online in other countries, those who use the internet are avid social media users. Our latest U.S. survey shows that 73% of internet users are social networking site users. By comparison, in 20 of 24 nations surveyed, seven-in-ten or more internet users participate in sites like Facebook and Twitter, including slightly less than nine-in-ten internet users in Egypt (88%), Russia (86%), and the Philippines (86%). Only in China do less than a majority of internet users access a social networking site.
That means that many of the countries in our global survey show a higher share of internet users as social media aficionados. However, it is important to note that internet access is much less common in all of these emerging and developing countries compared to the U.S., so as a total proportion of the population social networking usage is still practiced only among a minority in most of the countries surveyed. But those who go online in poorer countries are early adopters and they are enthusiastic to try the newest digital technology applications. Thus, these countries have a relatively modest share of their entire population online, but those who are online are eager for social media to a greater degree than Americans are.
