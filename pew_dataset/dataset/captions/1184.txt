In 1995, only about one in 10 adults in the U.S. were going online.21 As of August 2011, the U.S. internet population includes 78% of adults (and 95% of teenagers).22 Certain aspects of the current internet population still strongly resemble the state of internet adoption in 2000, when one of Pew Internet’s first reports found that minorities, adults living in households with lower incomes, and seniors were less likely than others to be online. “Those who do not use the Internet often do not feel any need to try it, some are wary of the technology, and others are unhappy about what they hear about the online world,” the report concluded.
