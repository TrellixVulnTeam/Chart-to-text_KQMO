In 24 emerging and developing nations surveyed, internet adoption varies widely. In countries such as Russia, Argentina, Chile, and Venezuela, more than half the adult population says they use the internet. But that number is far lower in Pakistan, where only 8 percent of adults do, and Ghana, where only 26% are online.
In the U.S., 84% use the internet. Some 71% of Americans use the internet at least daily; another 13% use it weekly or less often. The U.S. data show considerably higher adoption and usage rates of the internet than the figures coming from emerging nations. Roughly speaking, higher-adoption locales like Russia and Argentina show tech adoption similar to the U.S. in 2005, middle-adoption locales like China show adoption similar to rates in the U.S. in 2000-2001, and lower-adoption places like Ghana show adoption similar to rates in the US in the mid- to late-1990s.
