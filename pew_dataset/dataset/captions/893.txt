Veterans of the post-9/11 wars are among those who give the VA low marks. A survey conducted Aug. 1 â€“ Dec.15 last year by the Washington Post and Kaiser Family Foundation of soldiers who had served in Iraq or Afghanistan found that 58% rated the job the VA was doing to meet the needs of veterans as only fair or poor, while just 38% graded it excellent or good.
The veterans agency fared somewhat better in an extensive survey of post-9/11 veterans conducted in 2011 by the Pew Research Center. About half (51%) said the VA was doing an excellent or good job in meeting the needs of military veterans (with 12% rating it excellent) while 44% rated it only fair or poor.
