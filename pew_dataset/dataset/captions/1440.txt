Why then are Democrats and Republicans now reacting so differently? The answer may well lie, at least in substantial part, in the growing gap between the personal financial and labor market experiences of average – and even somewhat above average – wage earners compared with those of people in the uppermost tiers of the job market. And personal experience matters. While regression analysis of survey data shows that partisanship is an important factor, self-perceived financial status remains at least as powerful a factor as determining how one views the national economy (more powerful if actual income is also taken into account).
