Driven by WikiLeaks’ dissemination of those documents — which highlighted the difficult challenges faced by NATO forces — Afghanistan led the news for the week of July 26-Aug. 1, according to the Pew Research Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism. Taken together, coverage of the WikiLeaks saga and the overall war effort combined to fill 19% of the newshole.
The immigration debate accounted for 13% of last week’s coverage with the big news being a federal judge’s decision to block major elements of Arizona’s controversial new immigration law. That marks the second highest week of immigration coverage since PEJ began tracking it in January 2007. (The No. 1 week was 16% from April 26-May 2, right after the Arizona measure was signed into law.)
The announced departure of much-criticized Tony Hayward as CEO of BP helped fuel the continuing coverage of the Gulf oil spill, which filled 12% of the newshole from July 26-Aug. 1 — the same level as the previous week.
