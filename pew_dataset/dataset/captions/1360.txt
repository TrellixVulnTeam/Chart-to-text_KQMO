Although John McCain broke his post-election silence in a jokey interview with Jay Leno last week, Palin significantly overshadowed him. She was a lead newsmaker in more than 3% of last week’s stories examined by PEJ, meaning she appeared in at least 50% of the content of those stories. Clinton was very close behind, but McCain lagged well back, showing up as a lead newsmaker in 1% of last week’s coverage. By week’s end, even some friendly commentators were counseling Palin to adopt a lower profile.
