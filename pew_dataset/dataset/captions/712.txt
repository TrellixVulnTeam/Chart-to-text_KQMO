Of all U.S. advertising revenue, 28% comes from digital ads. For most legacy news sectors, digital ad revenue represents a much smaller fraction of their total intake, despite years of experimentation. Just 4% of local TV advertising revenue comes from digital, according to estimates from market research firm BIA/Kelsey, and this is not projected to grow much over the next five years. Newspapers see about 18% of their total ad revenue from digital, according to BIA/Kelsey, and this does not at present make up for falling print revenue. Even for digital-native news organizations, high levels of digital revenue are no guarantee of profitability.
