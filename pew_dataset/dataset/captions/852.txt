However, that assumption would be wrong. Both in terms of raw numbers and as a share of all employed people, fewer Americans are working more than one job than in the mid-1990s. Working two jobs or more has become less common, not more, since the end of the Great Recession.
According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of July nearly 6.8 million Americans worked more than one job, or 4.6% of all employed people. (The August jobs report, which will contain new data on the number of people who work multiple jobs, is scheduled to be released Friday.) Since the recession’s official end in June 2009, the average monthly number of this group has been just under 7 million — about half a million below the average during the 2001-07 expansion, and nearly 800,000 below the 1994-99 average.
