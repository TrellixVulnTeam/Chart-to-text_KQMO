Climate change and ISIS are India’s top international concerns. Here, Indians are in agreement with Europeans, who also rank these two issues as the greatest threats to their countries. There have been no major ISIS-led attacks in India, but the terrorist organization has made threats against the country.
Reflecting Indians’ positive views of the U.S., American power and influence was viewed as the least threatening of the international issues tested. Similarly, few Indians view tensions with Russia as a cause for concern, but a much larger share sees China as threatening to their country.
