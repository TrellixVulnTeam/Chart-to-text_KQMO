Since 2010, there has been considerable population change in the region due to war in Iraq and Syria, hostilities in other countries and related migration, but there is little reliable data to measure overall regional shifts in the last few years. Many Christians have left Iraq in recent years, though many stayed in the Middle East, fleeing to neighboring countries such as Jordan.
Most of the Christians in the Middle East (65%) are Orthodox Christians, including members of the Coptic Orthodox, Greek Orthodox and Syriac Orthodox churches. Catholics are a minority among the overall Christian population in the Middle East (27%), with slightly more than 2 million people. The rest of the Christians in the region are Protestant (7%).
Egypt has the largest Christian population in the Middle East, according to Pew Research estimates, which are based on Egyptian censuses. Leaders of the Coptic Orthodox Church in Egypt claim a much higher number of Christians in Egypt than are seen in Egyptâ€™s census.
