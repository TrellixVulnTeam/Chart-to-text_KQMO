Many parents know the passwords to their teen’s various accounts and devices, but knowing your teen’s log-in information is not universal. Nearly half (48%) of parents say they know the password to their teen’s email account while 43% are privy to their teen’s cellphone password. Fewer parents – 35% – say they know the password to at least one of their teen’s social media accounts.
