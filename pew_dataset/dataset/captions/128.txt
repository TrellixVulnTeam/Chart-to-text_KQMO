The Center’s 2019 survey found that sizable majorities of Nigerians expressed positive views toward China on a variety of economic issues: 83% said China’s growing economy is a good thing for their country, while a comparable share (82%) said Chinese investment is a good thing because it creates jobs in their country. In both cases, these shares were the highest out of the 11 emerging economies surveyed by the Center in 2019.
While Nigerians who live close to the Chinese railway project expressed more positive attitudes toward China after the project was completed, there was no consistent relationship between people’s distance to the project and other China-related questions in the Center’s survey, such as views toward China’s growing economy, its increasingly powerful military or Chinese President Xi Jinping.
