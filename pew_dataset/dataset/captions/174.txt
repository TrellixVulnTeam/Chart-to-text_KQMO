Spaniards are not happy with the state of democracy in their country. Only about a third (32%) of Spaniards say they are satisfied with how Spain’s democracy is working. However, satisfaction with democracy has increased by 12% since just last year, when the nation was in the midst of a corruption scandal that implicated and led to the ouster of the People’s Party (PP), which was the governing party at the time.
