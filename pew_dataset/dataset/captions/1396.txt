Recent years saw housing prices rise from a median sales price of $165,000 in 2002 to $221,900 in 2006, according to the National Association of Realtors. Early 2007, however, saw a drop. In January, the median sales price for homes in the United States (including condominiums) was $210,900, off $11,000 from the 2006 median. By April, the monthly median had climbed to $220,900. (Figures are not adjusted for inflation.) Walter Molony, a spokesman for NAR, noted that sales in early 2007 have been stronger in lower-priced regions (e.g. Texas) and slower in higher-priced regions (e.g. California, Florida), thereby dragging down the median figure.
