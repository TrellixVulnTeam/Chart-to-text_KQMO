Though many Americans apparently don’t realize it, the U.S. is producing considerably more of its own energy. Last year the U.S. generated a record 79.1 quadrillion Btu (British thermal units) domestically, nearly 14% more energy than in 2005, largely due to increased production of oil and natural gas.
Beginning in 2011, natural gas supplanted coal as the nation’s single-biggest source of domestically produced energy, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. In the first half of this year, 11.95 trillion cubic feet of “dry” (or consumer-grade) natural gas were produced, slightly above the same period last year and 7.9% more than in the first six months of 2011.
