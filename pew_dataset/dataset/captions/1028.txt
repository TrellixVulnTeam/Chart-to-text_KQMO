Driven by unauthorized immigration from Mexico, U.S. Border Patrol apprehensions rose through the 1990s and peaked at 1.7 million in fiscal 2000. After reaching somewhat lower levels for 2001-2007, apprehensions fell dramatically from 2007 to 2011. In 2012, the number of unauthorized immigrants apprehended at the Mexican border rose modestly, to 365,000, but only because of growing apprehensions of non-Mexicans; apprehensions of Mexicans continued to decline.
