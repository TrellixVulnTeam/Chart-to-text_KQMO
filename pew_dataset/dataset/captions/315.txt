Looking only at women nearing the end of their childbearing years, 9% report that they have ever personally undergone a fertility treatment or had a spouse or partner do so, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of National Center for Health Statistics data. (An additional 5% of these women report that they or their partner sought medical advice or testing regarding fertility, but did not undergo any additional treatments.)
Among women ages 35 to 44, those with at least a bachelor’s degree, those with incomes of $75,000 or more and those who are white are particularly likely to say they have personally undergone fertility treatments or to have had a spouse or partner do so. For example, among white women in this age group, 12% say they’ve undergone this type of treatment, compared with 3% of black and 5% of Hispanic women.
