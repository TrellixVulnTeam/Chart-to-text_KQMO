When those who cite multiple frustrations with the tax system are asked what bothers them most, a similar hierarchy of concerns is evident: About a quarter of the public (28%) says they are most bothered by the feeling that corporations do not pay their fair share and 25% say the same about wealthy people not paying their fair share. Fewer (19%) point to the complexity of the tax system, while much smaller percentages cite the amount they pay in taxes (7%) and the feeling that the poor donâ€™t pay their fair share (4%).
The national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted Feb. 18-22 among 1,504 adults, finds that about half (53%) say they pay about the right amount in taxes, considering what they get from the federal government; fewer (40%) feel like they pay more than their fair share in taxes. Just 4% say they pay less than their fair share of taxes. These views have changed little since December 2011.
