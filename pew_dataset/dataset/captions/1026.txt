This is substantially less than the share who very closely followed news about shootings last December at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. (57%) or last July in an Aurora, Colo. movie theater (48%). About four-in-ten (44%) followed the 2009 shooting at the Fort Hood Army post in Texas very closely.
