In January 2009, 65% could recall the name of a person Obama had selected for a role in his administration (a level of awareness that was driven in large party by familiarity with his pick for Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton). In January 2001, fewer than half (43%) could name an appointee of George W. Bush; and in January 1993, just 21% could identify a person Bill Clinton had nominated for his cabinet or other high-level post.
