As for types of games that Americans like to play, strategy and puzzle games are the most popular among those included in the survey. About six-in-ten adults who say they play video games often or sometimes report that they typically play these types of games (62% each). Adventure, shooter, role-playing, team sport or racing and simulation games are all somewhat less commonly played, with about half of video game players or fewer saying they typically play these types of games.
