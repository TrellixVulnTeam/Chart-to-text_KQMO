Three of the top four newsmakers of the week, not including Obama, were tied to the president-elect. The speculation about whether Hillary Clinton would be named secretary of state made her the lead newsmaker in 3% of the stories for the week. Eric Holder, Obamaâ€™s pick for attorney general, was 2nd at 2%. Joe Lieberman, who faced retribution for supporting McCain but ultimately got to keep his committee chairmanship in the Senate, was 4th. (Obama, who dominated all others, was the top newsmaker in 8% of all the stories last week).
