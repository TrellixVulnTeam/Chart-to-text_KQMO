A new national survey by Pew Research Center of 1,503 adults, conducted Jan. 10-15, 2018, finds that strengthening the economy continues to rank among the public’s leading priorities (71% top priority), along with defending against terrorism (73%) and improving the educational system (72%).
However, fewer view the economy as a top priority than did so four (80%) or eight (83%) years ago. Over the same period, the share rating improving the job situation as a top priority also has declined; 62% say this today, its lowest point in a decade. In 2014, 74% viewed the job situation as a top priority and 81% did so in 2010.
Reducing the budget deficit also has declined among the public’s policy priorities. Currently, just 48% say cutting the deficit should be a top policy priority for the president and Congress, down from 63% in 2014. A year earlier, in 2013, the share citing the deficit as a top priority was high as at any point in the past two decades (72%).
