Among registered voters who have seen or heard campaign ads, 53% say they generally do not pay attention, while 46% do pay attention to them. In this regard, Republicans and Democrats have something to agree on: About half of each group (51% of Democrats, 48% of Republicans) say they do not pay attention to campaign commercials; independents are more likely than partisans to disregard campaign ads (59% pay no attention).
