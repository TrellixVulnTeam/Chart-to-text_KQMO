Younger adults’ interest in soccer likely relates to higher participation rates than their parents’ generation. Participation in US Youth Soccer, the largest such national organization, jumped from about 100,000 in 1974 to 800,000 in 1980 to 3.02 million in 2000. But participation has mostly stalled since then, and membership remains at 3.02 million (while the American Youth Soccer Organization counts over 500,000 members).
