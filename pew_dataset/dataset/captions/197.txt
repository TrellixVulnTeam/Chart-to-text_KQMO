Puerto Rico’s population last saw modest increases in the 1990s, and in recent years has experienced accelerating declines. Losses started around the beginning of the island’s economic recession in 2006 and have continued since then. From 2015 to 2018, Puerto Rico’s population decreased by 2.7% per year on average, compared with 1.4% from 2010 to 2015.
