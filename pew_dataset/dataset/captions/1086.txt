Attitudes have changed dramatically since then, especially in the past few decades. While there are no trends going all the way back to 1969, the General Social Survey has asked since 1973 if “sexual relations between two adults of the same sex” is always wrong, almost always wrong, wrong only sometimes or not wrong at all.
The public’s opposition to homosexual behavior stayed steady until the early 1990s. Back in the 1973 General Social Survey, 73% said sexual relations between two adults of the same sex was “always wrong” and 11% said it was “not wrong at all.” The share saying “always wrong” continued to be large and peaked at 77% in 1991, but public opinion has sharply shifted since then. Today, 46% say sexual relations between two adults of the same sex is “always wrong” and about as many (44%) say it is “not wrong at all.”
