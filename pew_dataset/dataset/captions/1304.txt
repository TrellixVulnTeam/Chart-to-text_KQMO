In a multivariate analysis to see which factors matter most in predicting those who may or will not participate in the census, age is the most important predictor. Even when controlling for other demographic characteristics, analysis finds that younger Americans are more likely to say they might not participate. For those younger than age 30, the probability of likely non-participation is .18, compared with a probability of only .04 for those age 50 and older.
Education also is a factor in predicted census participation, even controlling for age and other demographic characteristics. For those with a high school education or less, the probability of not participating is .11 whereas those with a college education have a probability of .05. Gender, party and race and ethnicity are not significantly related to whether someone might not participate. And after controlling for other demographic characteristics, income and home ownership, are not significantly related to intention to participate.
