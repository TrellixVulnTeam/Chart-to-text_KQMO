A careful look at aggregated data from Pew Research polling in 2011 and 2012 reveals the nuanced nature of opinion on the issue and the large amount of gray area. While a majority of Americans say they support some abortion rights, more of those say abortion should be legal in “most” cases (33%) rather than “all” (20%). On the other side of the debate, 25% say abortion should be illegal in “most” cases and 16% say it should be illegal in “all” instances. In other words, majorities of both supporters and opponents of abortion rights approve of some exceptions.
