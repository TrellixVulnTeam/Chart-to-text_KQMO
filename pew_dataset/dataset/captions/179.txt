These and other policy changes – rather than an increase in migrant apprehensions at the border – appear to the driving factor behind the recent surge in criminal immigration cases. While criminal arrests and prosecutions for immigration offenses both reached their highest level in two decades in fiscal 2018, the number of border apprehensions that year (396,579) remained far below the levels recorded throughout most of the 1990s and early 2000s, when the number of apprehensions regularly topped 1 million per year. The BJS study notes that the number of criminal immigration arrests per 100 apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border nearly doubled between fiscal 2017 and 2018, rising from 12.2 arrests per 100 apprehensions to 21.
