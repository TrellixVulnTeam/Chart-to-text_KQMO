Other than education, getting and keeping jobs has been key to improved Hispanic economic prospects. From its high in 1992, the overall unemployment rate dropped by half to 5.7 in 2000. However, in December 2001, Latino unemployment stood at 7.8 percent, compared to 4.4 percent for whites. Relative to native-born Latinos, immigrants have had lower rates of unemployment during this period of growth. How this story plays out in the current recession remains to be seen.
Hispanics are heavily reliant on employment with few alternative sources of income: 68 percent of Hispanic adults are in the labor force. Among the major Hispanic populations, Cubans had the highest rate of unemployment at 10 percent, with a 57 percent labor force participation rate. Mexican Americans had an unemployment rate of 8.1 percent and nearly 70 percent of them were in the labor force. Latinos of Central and South American origin had an unemployment rate of 6.7 percent and more than 72 percent of these Latinos were in the labor force.
