Journalism educators attending last weekâ€™s conference held by the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication were greeted with news of the shrinking population in their classrooms. According to a new report from the University of Georgia (pdf), undergraduate enrollments in journalism and mass communication programs declined 2.9% in 2012, marking only the second time in two decades that they have dropped for two consecutive years. They fell 0.5% in 2011.
