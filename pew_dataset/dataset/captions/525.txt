One frequently heard critique of today’s economy, especially since the Great Recession, is that most newly created jobs don’t pay very well. There’s some truth in that: The BLS data indicate that nearly half of the jobs predicted to be created by 2024 are in occupations with median wages of less than $40,000 a year. Bear in mind, though, that such occupations already accounted for 59% of all jobs in 2014. In fact, the fastest growth is projected to come in higher-paying occupations: Those with median annual wages of $60,000 and higher are projected to grow at a combined rate of 9.3%. Those occupations overwhelmingly require higher levels of preparation and above-average levels of social skills, analytical skills or both.
