Americans are also closely divided over whether transgender people should be able to use public restrooms that correspond to their current gender identity. Roughly half of all adults (51%) say transgender people should be able to use the restroom that matches the gender with which they currently identify, while 46% say they should be required to use the restroom of their birth gender. In addition, young adults – those ages 18-29 – are far more likely than their elders to take the position that transgender people should be allowed to use restrooms that correspond to their current gender identify.
