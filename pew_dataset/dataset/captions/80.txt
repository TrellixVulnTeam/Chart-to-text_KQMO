The U.S. foreign-born population reached a record 44.8 million in 2018. Since 1965, when U.S. immigration laws replaced a national quota system, the number of immigrants living in the U.S. has more than quadrupled.

However, todayâ€™s immigrant share remains below the record 14.8% share in 1890, when 9.2 million immigrants lived in the U.S.
