Ten of the 12 companies reported revenue growth through the third quarter of 2014 (January – September) compared with the same period a year earlier (21st Century Fox and Meredith operate on a fiscal year that ends June 30, therefore the revenues reported here for those two companies are for July 1 through September 30, 2014). Media General sits at the top, with $458 million in revenue for the nine months ending in September 30, 2014, an 187% growth from the previous year. During this accounting period, Media General owned 32 local TV stations in 29 markets, including 13 that it acquired in a merger with Young Broadcasting in November 2013. In March 2014, Media General announced plans to expand further by purchasing LIN Media. The merger was completed in December 2014, bringing the Media General total to 71 stations in 48 markets.
Gannett ranks second in revenue growth for this time period with a 97% increase across its 46 stations. Only CBS and 21st Century Fox, which own 30 and 28 stations respectively saw their broadcast revenue flatten compared to the same period in the previous year. CBS said the previous year’s revenue had been boosted by its Super Bowl broadcast but it also reported “softness in the advertising marketplace.” 21st Century Fox attributed its flat revenue to lower entertainment prime time ratings.
