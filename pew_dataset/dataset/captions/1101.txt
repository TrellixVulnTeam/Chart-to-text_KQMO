The assassination captured the nation’s attention, with 90% of the public later recalling that they saw the event “at about the time” it happened, according to a 1992 survey by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press. Among people who were born in 1957 or before, the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, the Moon landing and the funeral of John F. Kennedy (born in 1952 or before) were recalled by virtually all of those old enough to remember the events.
