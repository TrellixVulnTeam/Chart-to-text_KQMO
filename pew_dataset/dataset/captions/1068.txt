Home ownership was on the rise well before the mortgage mania of the mid-2000s, aided by falling interest rates and government policies designed to encourage it. But the bursting of the bubble and the wrenching recession that followed forced tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of families to lose their homes; home ownership now is down to levels not seen since the mid-1990s. The bustâ€™s impact was particularly severe on non-whites: While home ownership among non-Hispanic whites is 2.8 percentage points below its peak, home ownership among blacks is down 6.6 percentage points to 43.1%, and down 6 percentage points among people of all other races, to 54.6%. Among Hispanics, home ownership has fallen to 45.3% in the first quarter of this year from 50.1% in the third quarter of 2007.
