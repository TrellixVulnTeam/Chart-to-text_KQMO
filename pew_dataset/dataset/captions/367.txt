Most Iranians believe religious figures have a role to play in government, but they’re divided on just how big that role should be. In a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, just four-in-ten Iranians said religious figures should have a large influence in political matters; 30% said they should have little or no influence. Younger Iranians, who had lived their entire lives under Iran’s Islamic Republic established after the 1979 revolution, were less supportive than their elders of a large political role for religious figures.
