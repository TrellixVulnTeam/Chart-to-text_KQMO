A new Pew Research Center survey asked respondents an open-ended question (with multiple responses accepted): What do you like the least about Christmas or the holiday season?
The three top responses all involve shopping or money: a third of Americans (33%) say they dislike the commercialism or materialism of the holidays; roughly one-in-five (22%) cite the high expenses of the season or the expectation of buying gifts; and one-in-ten (10%) mention shopping or crowded stores.
