Skepticism is especially pervasive in the Palestinian territories. In a recent Pew Research Center poll, 61% of Palestinians said they did not believe a way can be found for Israel and an independent Palestinian state to coexist peacefully. In fact, a 45%-plurality said the best way to achieve statehood is through armed struggle. Just 15% think non-violent resistance is the best strategy. And there is little faith in negotiations â€“ only 15% believe negotiations are the best path to statehood.
