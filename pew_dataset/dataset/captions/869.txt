In the vast majority of local TV newsrooms, budgets either grew or held steady in 2013. About half of the news directors surveyed (52%) said they increased their news budgets last year, compared with 49% the year before and 38% in 2011. But there were differences by market size. Indeed, 54% of the mid-sized market stations (51-100) said they increased their budgets compared with 41% whose budgets were cut or stayed the same. But in the biggest 25 TV markets, the percentage of stations increasing their budgets in 2013 (48%) was identical to the percentage that cut or did not increase their spending.
