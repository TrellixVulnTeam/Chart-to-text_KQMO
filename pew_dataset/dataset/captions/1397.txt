Behind these sentiments is, in part, a general notion that ICTs don’t contribute to personal productivity. Only one in three Americans who have cell phones or internet access agrees “a lot” with the proposition that ICTs make them more productive — although among several techoriented groups (Omnivores, Connectors, and Productivity Enhancers, roughly one quarter of the population), 74% agree “a lot” about ICTs positive impact on their productivity. But in stark contrast, among four groups, comprising 43% of the general population, just 7% agree “a lot” that ICTs improve their productivity. Those groups are the Lackluster Veterans, Connected but Hassled, Light but Satisfied, and Indifferents.
