In the first months of the Trump administration, the top countries of origin for refugees have been the Democratic Republic of the Congo (3,235), followed by Burma (Myanmar) (2,470), Iraq (1,923), Somalia (1,879), Syria (1,779) and Ukraine (1,603). These six countries have made up two-thirds (67%) of all refugees entering the U.S. since Jan. 21, 2017. Of these, three are majority-Muslim origin countries (Iraq, Somalia and Syria).
