These days, Facebook’s strongest growth is coming from overseas. The monthly user base (defined as those who accessed the site at least once in the previous 30 days) grew just 4.1% in the U.S. and Canada last year, according to the company’s annual 10-K report. In Europe, it grew by 8%; in Asia, 23.5% (including Australia and New Zealand); and in the rest of the world, it grew by 23.7%. American and Canadian users, in fact, now make up less than a sixth of Facebook’s total user base.
