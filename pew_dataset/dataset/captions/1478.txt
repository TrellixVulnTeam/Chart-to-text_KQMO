In the mid-1990s, as the stock market was beginning its metoric rise, the month-to-month changes in the Dow Jones Industrial Average had little connection to shifts in consumer sentiment, as measured in monthly surveys conducted by the University of Michigan. From 1992 to 1994, and again from 1995 to 1997, changes in consumer confidence were virtually unrelated to movement of the Dow (see chart).
But as the stock market boom peaked at decade’s end (1998-2000), the relationship between fluctuations in the stock market and consumer attitudes became much more closely linked. Since 1998, roughly 20% of the change in consumer confidence – as measured on a monthly basis by the University of Michigan – can be attributed to movement in the stock market. Such a linkage had only been apparent once before, at the height of the so-called ‘Reagan recovery’ (1983-85).
