Some had difficulties with their tablets. Pew Research Center surveys have shown over time that later adopters of the internet often say they need help with their new devices. Not surprisingly, a share of these new users struggled with the device. Seven-in-ten called tech support to get help with the tablet, and 43% experienced login or password issues. Nearly a third (32%) reported that it was a challenge learning how to use the touch screen. And 14% said it was a challenge to keep the tablet charged.
