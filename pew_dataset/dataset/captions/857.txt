As part of his economic agenda, Pe√±a Nieto proposed allowing private international investment in the oil and gas industry for the first time in over 75 years, legislation that was recently finalized by the Mexican Congress. Under the new laws, private companies will be able to conduct oil exploration in Mexico, including through partnerships with Pemex, the state-owned petroleum company. The survey asked whether respondents support or oppose allowing companies from other countries to invest in Pemex. A majority of Mexicans (57%) oppose opening up Pemex to foreign businesses. Only about a third (34%) approve. Even PRI supporters are divided (44% support vs. 46% oppose).
