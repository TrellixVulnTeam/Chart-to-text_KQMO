Currently, 38% say they followed news about the debt limit debate very closely, little different from the 34% that said this one week earlier according to the latest Weekly News Interest Index survey, conducted July 21-24 among 999 adults by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The survey was conducted before the prime-time speeches on July 25 by President Obama and House Speaker John Boehner.
Public interest in the debt stalemate has risen over the past month, from 29% during the first week of July to 38% this week. Interest is well below the 47% who tracked the budget showdown in early April, but that survey was conducted over the final weekend before a government shutdown loomed. The week earlier – roughly comparable in time to this week – just 30% were following the shutdown debate very closely.
