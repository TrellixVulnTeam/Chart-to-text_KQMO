About 16 million Americans are self-employed, according to BLS data from July of this year. But the impact of the self-employed is wider: A Pew Research Center report found that self-employed Americans and the people working for them together accounted for 30% of the nation’s workforce, or 44 million jobs in total in 2014. Only about a quarter of self-employed people (3.4 million) had employees of their own, though, and those who did have workers didn’t have very many: Among self-employed people with employees, the median in 2014 was three and the average was 8.6.
