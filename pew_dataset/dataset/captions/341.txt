The institution of marriage continues to change. Half of U.S. adults today are married, a share that has remained relatively stable in recent years but is down significantly over previous decades. Cohabitation among unmarried partners is rising, including among a growing share of unmarried parents. The share of U.S. adults living without a spouse or partner has also increased, from 39% in 2007 to 42% in 2017.
