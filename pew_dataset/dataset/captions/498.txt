While the general sentiment among police that the media treat them unfairly is shared across gender, racial and ethnic lines, some officers feel more strongly about it than others. White officers (43%), for example, are more likely than their black colleagues (34%) to strongly agree that the media treat police unfairly. Among Hispanic officers, 40% strongly agree. Age is also correlated with views about the media. While 46% of officers ages 18 to 44 strongly agree that the media treat the police unfairly, fewer of those ages 45 and older (36%) express the same view.
Police department administrators have a different view on the media than rank-and-file officers and sergeants. Only 29% of administrators strongly agree that the media treat police unfairly, compared with roughly four-in-ten rank-and-file officers and sergeants.
