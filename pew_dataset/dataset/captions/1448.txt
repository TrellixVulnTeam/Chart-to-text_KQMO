The Pew Internet Project has in the past asked about online donations to charities following major events. After 9/11, 10% of internet users, or about 11 million Americans, said they had at one time made an online donation. These donors did not necessarily give because of the terror attacks, but a number obviously were inspired by the attacks to make contributions. Following the Asian tsunami at the end of 2004, 13% of internet users, or 17 million Americans, said they had made a donation to charity online. Again, these donations were not necessarily made on behalf of tsunami relief efforts, but it was probably true that the tragedy had moved at least some new entrants into the online donor population.
