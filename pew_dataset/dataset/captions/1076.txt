While 26% of Americans say they followed news about the Zimmerman trial very closely about as many (24%) say they tracked news about a plane crash in San Francisco very closely.
Among other stories, 18% followed news about the debate over immigration policy very closely, while comparable percentages paid very close attention to efforts by Edward Snowden to gain asylum (16%) and the situation in Egypt (15%).
The “royal baby” attracted very little public interest: Just 5% followed news about about the upcoming birth of Prince William and Kate Middleton’s first baby, one of the lowest levels of interest for any news story this year. In recent years, news about the royals has been very limited, with one notable exception – the death of Princess Diana in 1997.
