The new national survey by the Pew Research Center, conducted August 20-24 among 1,501 adults finds that 33% say there are plenty of jobs available where they live, while 58% say that jobs are difficult to find. The share saying jobs are available has ticked up from 29% in July and 27% in April. Nearly two years ago, in December 2012, just 22% said there were plenty of jobs locally.
Moreover, there is broad agreement among the public that the economic recovery remains weak. Two-thirds (67%) say “the economy is recovering, but not so strongly.” Just 8% say the economy is recovering strongly, while three times as many (24%) say it is not recovering at all. These opinions are virtually unchanged from April.
