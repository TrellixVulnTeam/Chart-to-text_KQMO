From July 26-Aug. 1, the president and his administration registered as lead newsmaker in 8% of the week’s stories, up from 5% the previous week. (To be a lead newsmaker, a figure must register in at least 50% of a story.)
The No. 2 newsmaker was Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel who figured in 4% of the stories after the House Ethics Committee charged the former Ways and Means Committee chair with 13 counts of ethics violations. He was followed by another figure whose recent headlines haven’t been kind, departing BP boss Tony Hayward (3%).
Robert Dudley, the man tapped to replace Hayward at BP was the fourth-leading newsmaker, at 2% of the stories. And coming in as No. 5 was another New York Democratic congressman, Anthony Weiner (also 2%), who erupted in an attention-getting outburst against Republicans during a debate over a bill that would provide money to pay health costs for 9/11 first responders. Even in a time of increasingly angry political rhetoric, the congressman’s behavior stood out. “Weiner Goes Ballistic on the House Floor,” declared the headline on the Forbes website.
