For example, when reported as a whole, the views of Asian Americans naturally represent some groups more than others. The views of Chinese, Indian and Filipino Americans are more heavily represented than those of Pakistani or Laotian Americans because the former groups make up a much larger share of the Asian American population than the latter groups. Critically, the more populous groups tend to have higher income levels and more formal education than the less populous Asian origin groups.
