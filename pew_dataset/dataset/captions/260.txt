Younger Venezuelans and those with higher levels of education are slightly less likely to trust the government. Partisan differences are particularly stark. Those who identified as supporters of Maduroâ€™s United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) when the poll was conducted are much more likely to trust the government than those who support other parties or have no partisan affiliation; 71% of PSUV backers trust the national government, compared with just 20% of other people.
