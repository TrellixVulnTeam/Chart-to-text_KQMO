The election is the publicâ€™s top news story this week: Fully 60% say they followed news about the presidential election very closely. That is the same as the percentage tracking election news during the week that Obama was elected president four years ago (60%).
Nearly half (46%) followed news about the impact of Hurricane Sandy very closely, down slightly from 53% a week prior.
Interest in news about the fiscal cliff nearly equals interest in news about the economy. Nearly four-in-ten (38%) followed news about the debate in Washington over the possible spending cuts and tax increases very closely; 41% paid very close attention to economic news. In July, just 23% followed news about the possible tax and spending changes very closely.
