Kenya is on the forefront of a banking revolution; a majority of Kenyans (56%) make or receive payments using cell phones. The number of Kenyans engaged in this activity is higher than any of the other 24 countries surveyed in our spring 2013 survey. In fact, only in neighboring Uganda do even a plurality of people say they use their cell phones for mobile banking transactions.
