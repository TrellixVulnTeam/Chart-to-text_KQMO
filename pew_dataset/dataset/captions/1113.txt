President Obama himself also enjoys high ratings from South Koreans. In the most recent survey, 77% express confidence in the American presidentâ€™s ability to handle world affairs, with only 20% saying they lack confidence in him. Similar percentages voiced positive evaluations of Obama in the years after his initial election. Assessments of former President Bush were much harsher. When he left office in 2008, only three-in-ten South Koreans had confidence in Bush, while 64% had little or no confidence.
