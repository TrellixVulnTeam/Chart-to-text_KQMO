The rising number of convictions for unlawful reentry has altered the offense composition of federal offenders. In 2012, immigration offenses—of which unlawful reentry is the largest category—represented 30% of offenders, up from 5% in 1992.
Unlawful reentry cases alone accounted for 26% of sentenced federal offenders—second only to drug offenses in 2012. This is up 13-fold since 1992, when offenders sentenced for unlawful reentry made up just 2% of sentenced offenders. These trends match the population growth in the Federal Bureau of Prisons system.
