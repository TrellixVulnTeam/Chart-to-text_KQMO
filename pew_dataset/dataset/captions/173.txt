People in the former East Germany earn less than their counterparts in the former West. Total compensation, gross wages and salaries, and disposable (or after-tax) income have long been lower in the former East Germany than in the former West, according to the government’s report.
In 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, per-capita disposable income was €19,909 per year in the former East Germany – the equivalent of about $22,500 based on the average euro-to-dollar exchange rate that year. By comparison, disposable income in the former West Germany was €23,283 a year, or about $26,300.
Put another way, people in the former East Germany earned 86% the after-tax income of their West German counterparts in 2017. That percentage has changed little in recent years, but is far higher than in 1991, when per-capita disposable income in the former East was only 61% of that in the former West.
