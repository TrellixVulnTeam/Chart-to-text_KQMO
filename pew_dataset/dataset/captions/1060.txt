Public interest in news about Egypt is higher than it has been in the past few months. But it is far lower than during the Arab Spring two years ago.
In the current survey, 22% say they are following news about political violence in Egypt very closely. In February 2011, when former President Hosni Mubarak resigned after weeks of public protests, 39% were following events in Egpt very closely.
